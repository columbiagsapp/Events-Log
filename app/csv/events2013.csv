With the development of China-EU ties in the recent years, cultural and intellectual communications between China and Europe have gotten closer and deeper. Initiation in 2012 of the &ldquo;China-Europe High-Level&nbsp;Humanistic Exchange and Dialogue Mechanism,&rdquo; aimed at turning humanistic communication into the third pillar of China-EU relations, has provided a fine platform for China-Europe communications in the fields of education, culture, science and technology and youth exchanges. &ldquo;China-Europe Cultural Summit&rdquo; as one of a series of high-end, pattern-setting and innovative activities has been incorporated into this framework.<br />
The purpose of the &ldquo;China-Europe Humanistic Think Tank Summit&rdquo; is to gather innovations, research findings, networking and experiences from talented persons in China and Europe to set a precedent&nbsp;for in-depth communication and long-term cooperation between high-end international resources and the Chinese government. This will have a far-reaching influence in implementing China&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;building international cultural metropolises&rdquo; and &ldquo;urbanized development.&rdquo; It is expected to be another successful example of China-Europe humanistic and intellectual exchange.<br />
At present, cultural development has become one of the most important strategies of the Chinese government.<br />
Humanities, arts and culture&mdash;having potential to emancipate people from convention&mdash;are of far-reaching influence, while proactive pursuit of cultural diversity and multi-dimensional extension of thought is the core of creativity and innovation. With respect to society&rsquo;s richness and openness, knowledge-sharing among different social groups, fostering a uniquely urban culture, multi-layered integration in humanities venues plus international exchange and cooperation on urban issues, there is vast space for development in Chinese&nbsp;cities, including Beijing. A genuine communication platform and cooperative endeavor at the international level is earnestly needed.<br />
Organizing such an event, we hope to favorably influence the &ldquo;view of China&rdquo; as it takes form within foreign think tanks, and thereby to influence the ongoing formation of a &ldquo;view of China&rdquo; within international community.",Beijing,Studio-X Beijing

Safari SZHK ,Friday,20,December,2013,Tour,Studio-X,"Shenzhen and Hong Kong residents can now use the metro to explore urban animal life.&nbsp; A public art project called &ldquo;Safari SZHK&rdquo; makes self-guided tours for metro riders to use on the train. We invite you to use the city&rsquo;s metro system and the Safari Base Camp to tour our shared urban zoo!<br />
<br />
The East Rail and Luobao lines are physical, urban transects through the region&rsquo;s most diverse range of ecosystems, on both sides of the border. They connect Shekou Port to Victoria Harbor, passing through mangrove forests, urban villages, and high-rise roosts along the way. Safari SZHK circulates audio tours and maps exploring the complexity, biodiversity, conflicts, and potentials of urban ecosystems.<br />
<br />
Tours are available online at www.safariszhk.org. To use Safari SZHK, anyone can download maps and audio files onto their computer, mp3 player or smart phone; and listen to narratives about animal life on the Hong Kong&rsquo;s East Rail Line and Shenzhen&rsquo;s Luobao line. Audio stories are timed to each metro stop from Kowloon to Shekou Port so riders can listen while they look out the train window. The project will be exhibited at the 2013 Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture (http://www.szhkbiennale.org/) at two sites. &ldquo;Shenzhen Base Camp&rdquo; presents large-format maps and drawings of existing animal habitats in urban areas alongside related research from New York, Beijing and Sao Paulo. &ldquo;Hong Kong Base Camp&rdquo; includes a sound installation, and large-format drawings of design proposals for new, hybrid habitats created by graduate architecture students at the Hong Kong University.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This project and exhibition were created by Juan Du at the Hong Kong University Faculty of Architecture, the graphic design firm MTWTF and the Columbia University Urban Landscape Lab. Research, podcasts, and exhibition posters were produced by students in a design studio led by Professor Juan Du at HKU, with students Ho Yi Chau, Xiangdong Hu, Mandy Kwok, Nathaniel Lam, Joyce Lee, Lok Yan Leung, Ee Harn Low, Wallace Ng, Tak Shing Tang, Yixi Wang, Fan Wen, Kin Man Wong, Cherry Cheung and Calvin Liang. Production and Design Assistance by Cherry Cheung and Pedro Goncalves at MTWTF.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Safari SZHK is the fourth in a series of tours that started in New York in 2009, and extended to Beijing in 2011 and S&atilde;o Paulo in 2013 through the Columbia Studio-X Global Network. The Safari series was founded by the Urban Landscape Lab and MTWTF. &nbsp;<br />

Infrastructure and Urban Development: A Tale of Two Cities,Tuesday,10,December,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"Few would contest that infrastructure has been key to the evolution of the world&rsquo;s great cities, or that maintaining public infrastructure is key to a city&rsquo;s continued growth and vitality.&nbsp; That infrastructure can take a variety of forms &ndash; clean water supply, water removal, telecom and energy, social infrastructure (such as parks and schools) and of course transportation.<br />
<br />
While all of these forms of infrastructure are necessary for a successful city, transportation has played a particularly seminal role in the development of western cities over the last hundred years. Public transit opened up parts of cities like London and New York that had hitherto been considered remote backwaters, prompting real estate development and strengthening the ability of the city to cater for people of diverse economic backgrounds and levels.<br />
<br />
Throughout much of the 20th century, both London and New York took privately-founded transit operations into public control and built complex and extensive underground transit networks that move millions of people each year.&nbsp; These were complemented by relatively efficient roadway and bridge networks that together allowed people to move freely and quickly across all parts of the city.<br />
<br />
However in the last several decades, the fate of the two cities - with respect to the continued evolution of their transportation networks &ndash; have been dramatically different. London has continued to expand and strengthen both its tube system and the roads and bridges that support the capital, with new tube lines, light rail systems, major new heavy rail connectors, new motorways and new bridges.&nbsp; New York has failed to replace several of its most decrepit bridges, is struggling to find funds to maintain what it has, and is only now undertaking construction to complete only part of a new subway line originally envisioned in the 1920&rsquo;s.<br />
<br />
This session will explore the factors that have led to this disparity, and pose some questions as to lessons that can be learned in comparing and contrasting these two cities.<br />

<strong>SYMPOSIUM| SCREENING: Of Sites and Contexts: engaging locality and the cultural networks of the Pearl River Delta</strong><br />
<br />
Venue: The Value Factory at the Bi-city Biennale of Urbanism\Architecture (UABB) in Shenzhen<br />
Language: English<br />
A collaboration between Hong Kong based non-profit organisations, POP-UP Studio-X Shenzhen, and the Value Factory at the Bi-city Biennale of Urbanism\Architecture (UABB) in Shenzhen.<br />
<br />
This one-day programme seeks to explore social, cultural and economic networks in the production and shaping of spatial narratives at the Value Factory of the Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture in Shenzhen.<br />
As a platform for discussion on art, architecture, and urbanism, &lsquo;Engaging locality and the cultural networks of the Pearl River Delta,&rsquo; examines the contexts of venues like the Value Factory, a rehabilitated float glass factory in Shekou, Shenzhen, as well as other sites of cultural regeneration. This event seeks to unpack notions of gentrification by looking at models of cultural production and activist practice through a network of practitioners, scholars, and academics from different disciplines.<br />

Welcome and Introduction by <strong>Marisa Yiu</strong> (Curator, POP-UP Studio-X Shenzhen &amp; Assistant Professor, School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong)<br />
<br />
This discussion will consider the recent history and development of economic and cultural policies in the Pearl River Delta region. Taking into consideration recent cultural projects, this panel seeks to explore questions of sustainability and formation of creative spaces in a capitalistic context and the commodification of cultural industries both past and present. This discussion will look upon the definitions of preservation, renewal of heritage sites, and their links to gentrification. It questions whom this renewal is for and the assumption of historical amnesia upon which such renewal hinges.<br />

Whose Utopia, Cao Fei (22min)<br />
Whose Utopia locates itself on the lives of workers at the Osram lighting factory in the Pearl River Delta region.

CASE STUDIES<br />
<strong>16.30 - 18.00:</strong><br />
Introduction by <strong>Chantal Wong</strong> (Strategy and Special Projects, Asia Art Archive)<br />
<br />
Taking locality as the starting point, each of the case studies inhabits the creative industry and economy while heeding the needs and wants of the local. This discussion seeks to explore the underlying exigency behind their practices, questioning the use of craft in a time when it is widely romanticised, the communities to which these case studies speak, and the longstanding effects of their practices.<br />

21st Century Liffey: Design Concepts for Dublin’s River Quays ,Friday,6,December,2013,Exhibition,Exhibitions,"The city is in a constant state of flux, a work in progress. The stagnation of space due to conflicts in governance produces a type of civic ambivalence, one which has an insidious impact, affecting the citizens&rsquo; ability to connect with their city. <em>21st Century Liffey</em> explores these realities along Dublin&rsquo;s most important, but frequently overlooked asset: its river. Through the development of a &quot;Rooms and Corridors&quot; strategy, Irish urban designers David Jordan and Fergus Browne re-imagine and re-vision the Liffey Quays as a green boulevard linking park to bay and north to south: in short, becoming the <em>mise en sc&egrave;ne</em> of the Irish capital.<br />
<br />
By merging theoretical discourse with conceptual design solutions, their thought-provoking exhibition illustrates innovative ways of perceiving urban environments from the perspective of the pedestrian and articulates the important role the river can play in creating legible city spaces. The transcending themes of their research give it a particularly international dimension, encouraging a global conversation about the future of our cities.<br />
<br />

Designing the Future,Tuesday,3,December,2013,Panel,Studio-X,"Addressing the immense challenges facing New York City in the coming decades &mdash; climate change, dramatic population growth, aging infrastructure, poverty, and more &mdash; will necessitate significant interventions in the built environment. Real progress will require highly creative thinking on the part of designers, government officials, concerned citizens, and many others.<br />
<br />
To help celebrate the 25th anniversary of its New York office, Arup put out a <a href=""http://architizer.com/blog/future-nyc/"">public call for blue-sky ideas</a> about the future of the city. On December 3, a panel will discuss some of the responses, as well as the possibilities and limitations of this kind of exercise. Can speculative thinking bring value to the day-to-day design process? Are some kinds more useful than others? How can designers and clients &mdash; public, private, and institutional &mdash; better reconcile the need to think big with the need to work within strict project constraints?<br />

The Crisis of Large-Scale Housing Production in the 1970s,Tuesday,26,November,2013,Panel,[object Object],"1973, the year of the first oil shock, marks a stark turning point in the conception of housing within architecture discourse. In the United States, a welfare-state approach toward low- and moderate-income housing was abandoned for a market-driven process. This change went hand-in-hand with a withdrawal of architects from the social project of housing, founded in a renewed belief in the autonomy of architecture. The separation between the social sciences and design disciplines continues to this day, as does the idea that quantity and quality, or socio-political demands and good design, are irreconcilable goals in housing.<br />
<br />

The Crisis of Large-Scale Housing Production in the 1970s,Tuesday,26,November,2013,Panel,[object Object],"1973, the year of the first oil shock, marks a stark turning point in the conception of housing within architecture discourse. In the United States, a welfare-state approach toward low- and moderate-income housing was abandoned for a market-driven process. This change went hand-in-hand with a withdrawal of architects from the social project of housing, founded in a renewed belief in the autonomy of architecture. The separation between the social sciences and design disciplines continues to this day, as does the idea that quantity and quality, or socio-political demands and good design, are irreconcilable goals in housing.<br />

<br />
The event will be held at the Columbia Global Centers | Middle East:&nbsp;<br />
5 Mohammad Al Sa&#39;d Al Batayneh Street<br />
King Hussein Park, Amman<br />
<br />
<strong>Myriam Ababsa&nbsp;</strong>is an associate research fellow in social geography at the French Institute for the Near East Institut Fran&ccedil;ais du Proche-Orient (at the IFPO in Amman)<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Her work focuses on the impact of public policies on regional and urban development in Jordan and Syria. She holds a PhD in geography from the University of Tours, France (2004). She is the author of :&nbsp;<em>Amman de pierre et de paix&nbsp;</em>(Paris: Autrement, 2007),&nbsp;<em>Raqqa, territoires et pratiques sociales d&rsquo;une ville syrienne&nbsp;</em>(Beirut: IFPO, 2009). She has co-edited with Dr. Rami Daher,&nbsp;<em>Cities, Urban Practices and Nation Building in Jordan&nbsp;</em>(Beirut: IFPO, 2011) and co-edited with Baudouin Dupret and Eric Denis&nbsp;<em>Popular Housing and</em>&nbsp;<em>Urban Land Tenure in the Middle East</em>&nbsp;(University of Cairo Press, 2012). Her last publication is the&nbsp;<em>Atlas of Jordan. History, Territories, Society</em>&nbsp;(Beirut&nbsp;: Ifpo 2013, 485 p.), written in english and arabic with a team of 48 scholars.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This first comprehensive Atlas of Jordan, written in english and arabic, aims to explain the formation of Jordanian territories since prehistoric times.<br />
<br />
Fourty-eight Jordanian, European and American experts associated with the&nbsp;<em>Institut Fran&ccedil;ais du Proche-Orient</em>&nbsp;were asked to study the spatial resilience of old structures: the complementarities among land areas (cultivated fields, steppe and scrubland) dating back to the Neolithic period; trade dynamics along the valleys (Wadi Jordan, Wadi Araba and Wadi Sirhan); and inherited administrative systems (urban structures of the first kingdoms of Amman, Moab and Edom; trade between Damascus and Jerusalem under the Ottoman Empire; and State control stopping at the borders of the Ottoman Bilad al-Sham and the Hejaz). Settled populations (<em>ma&rsquo;mura</em>) fluctuated for centuries across the boundary of dry farming areas, depending on the modes of state control of nomadic tribes and the technical expertise of water supply systems. The pilgrimage route developed along this boundary, along the ancestral route linking the south of the Arabian Peninsula to Damascus, which for centuries was the eastern limit of settled populations.<br />
<br />
The Atlas is structured in three parts&nbsp;: a first physical part, a second long historical part, and a third contemporary section.&nbsp;<strong>In the historical section of the atlas, historians study Jordan&rsquo;s administrative organization to ascertain whether the territory lying to the east of the Jordan River and the Wadi Araba was peripheral or at the heart of the kingdom.&nbsp;</strong>This determined whether armies and taxes could be levied under the Persians, Nabateans, Romans, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans and the British. Urban hierarchies are studied to show which fortified town best took advantage of their situation, to describe trade routes and road networks, and explain land use (mining, agriculture and early industry).<br />
<br />
<strong>The contemporary section of the atlas studies the nation&rsquo;s population and its geographical distribution.&nbsp;</strong>The stability of the Hashemite rule depends on the Jordanian social contract whereby Palestinian refugees are full Jordanian citizens and the kings of Jordan are guarantors of their right to return. The population of Transjordanian descent is organized into large urban families or into tribes in rural areas, and many work in the army and the government. Although they are the foundation of the nation, they occasionally also demand better distribution of national income, particularly in the southern and eastern districts, as was the case in Ma&rsquo;an in the late 1980s, in 1996 and in the 2000s. Jordan rentier&rsquo;s economy is studied from a sectorial and spatial perspective, showing that the proliferation of special economic zones and qualified industrial zones has led to a territorial breakup with strategic locations (Amman and Aqaba) coming under the Prime Minister&#39;s Office. Chapter 8 discusses the poverty reduction policies and job creation strategies implemented by successive governments. Social disparities are studied in detail, particularly in the capital in a chapter on urban policy, which is essential since half the population lives in 2% of the country. The last chapter presents the energy and environmental challenges that Jordan is facing and the solutions provided by megaprojects and development.<br />

<br />
<em>Islands and Atolls</em> asks how architecture might critically repurpose its traditionally limited disciplinary tools in order to make a meaningful impact at a territorial scale. Functioning as a landscape architect in a country that has no infrastructure for such a profession, Callejas questions pedagogical, disciplinary, and political norms at macro levels using micro tactics. As a result, PA 33 provocatively expands devices such as repetition and aggregation beyond their limits in scenarios where sociopolitical constraints seemingly prohibit what would normally be understood as an architectural intervention.<br />

In recent years, Brazil has discovered vast quantities of petroleum deep within its territorial waters, inciting the construction of a series of cities along its coast and in the ocean. We could term these developments as <em>Petropolises</em>, or cities formed from resource extraction. <em>The Petropolis of Tomorrow</em> is a design and research project, originally undertaken at Rice University that examines the relationship between resource extraction and urban development in order to extract new templates for sustainable urbanism. Organized into three sections: Archipelago Urbanism, Harvesting Urbanism, and Logistical Urbanism, which consist of theoretical, technical, and photo articles as well as design proposals, The Petropolis of Tomorrow elucidates not only a vision for water-based urbanism of the floating frontier city, it also speculates on new methodologies for integrating infrastructure, landscape, urbanism and architecture within the larger spheres of economics, politics, and culture that implicate these disciplines.<br />

The annual <strong>James Marston Fitch Symposium</strong> hosted by the Historic Preservation Program at Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Architecture Planning, and Preservation explores the question: Is there an East and West in Preservation? An examination of preservation practice in contexts of engagement between East and West seems to suggest there is dissonance between projected rhetorical positions and what occurs &ldquo;on the ground.&rdquo; In these engagements is preservation largely enacted on a set of consensus and globally forged principles tempered by national or regional customs or primarily on indigenous principles? Or, is the spectrum of practice even broader and more deeply colored by local contexts?<br />

<strong>About James Marston Fitch (1909-2000)</strong><br />
James Marston Fitch was architect and a Preservationist and founder of the Historic Preservation Program at Columbia University 1964 where he was a member of the faculty from 1954 to 1977. He taught and lectured widely and was a true internationalist &ndash; studying and writing about preservation in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the former Soviet Union as well as the Caribbean and South America. The activist Jane Jacobs considered that Fitch &quot;was the principal character in making the preservation of historic buildings practical and feasible and popular.&quot;<br />

Interpreter: The Kenneth Frampton Endowed Lecture (Grafton Architects),Wednesday,20,November,2013,Core Series,Core Series,"<strong>Yvonne Farrell</strong> and <strong>Shelley McNamara,</strong> Grafton Architects<br />
<br />
Response by <strong>Kenneth Frampton,&nbsp;</strong>Columbia University GSAPP<br />
<br />
In the third annual Kenneth Frampton Endowed Lecture, Grafton Architects Principals <strong>Yvonne Farrell </strong>and <strong>Shelley McNamara</strong> explore the architect&#39;s role as interpreter of various needs&mdash;from from site and space to language and culture&mdash;into built form. Drawing on their <a href=""http://www.graftonarchitects.ie/Universita-Luigi-Bocconi"">Universita Luigi Bocconi</a> in Milan, Italy, and a &ldquo;new cliff&rdquo; for the <a href=""http://www.graftonarchitects.ie/University-Campus-UTEC-Lima"">Universidad de Ingenier&iacute;a &amp; Tecnolog&iacute;a</a>&nbsp;(UTEC) that overlooks the Pacific Ocean in Lima, Peru, the architects grapple with highlighting difference, nuance, and social and cultural specificity over an &quot;Esperanto&quot; of architecture, and, recalling the language, literature, and visual metaphors of their native Ireland, question what is lost in translation.<br />

Urban Biotopes,Tuesday,19,November,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"<br />
<br />
<br />
Urban Biotopes is an international socially engaged art project delivering both artistic research within, and cultural exchange among social citizen and art initiatives in cities in Africa and Europe in 2014. The participating initiatives all distinguish themselves by addressing vital matters of concern of contemporary urban living in innovative ways, responding to issues of health and housing, youth and migration, mobility and economical subsistence. They do so &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo; and &lsquo;in the thick of life&rsquo; of each city, reason why they are referred to as &ldquo;urban biotopes&rdquo; and giving the overall project its name.<br />
On this basis, the aim of Urban Biotopes is to establish both a &ldquo;trans-local&rdquo; and a &quot;trans-continental&quot; dialogue by interweaving and connecting new context-specific, socially engaged art projects into the existing social activities of these biotopes. It does so in order to uncover and discuss different &ldquo;intentions, methods and techniques&rdquo; of locally employed imaginative urban practices for building &ldquo;sustainable cities&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Urban Biotopes is initiated by Beriln-based art association urban dialogues. &nbsp;The event is part of the programming of the festival Germany+Brazil 2013-14 and has the support of German Center for Science and Innovation of S&atilde;o Paulo&nbsp;&ndash; DWIH.<br />

He is the project director of the Urban Biotopes &ndash; Negotiating the Future of Urban Living.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
Moving the Curbs,Tuesday,19,November,2013,LiPS,LiPS,"Street design is an old art that was given over to traffic planners &amp; engineers in the 20th Century.&nbsp; This lecture will discuss ways that cities are moving their curbs to restore the primacy of walking.<br />
Streets historically have been the front yards, markets, and conduits of urban life.&nbsp; There are symbiotic relationships between streets, buildings and space which need to be nurtured and detailed.&nbsp; Good urban design works well at the street level.<br />
<br />
Michael King is an architect who designs streets.&nbsp; He has done so since he left Avery Hall in the early 90&#39;s and uses many of the skills learned there to challenge the transportation and urban design status quo.&nbsp; He has projects on 4 continents, including traffic calming, intersection designs, bicycle facilities, BRT corridors, road diets, design manuals, and workshops.",New York,"Room 114, Avery Hall"

With contributions by scholars, architects, and artists, Documentary Remains will examine exhibitions, exhibition research, curatorial practices, and their current position within the field. A polemic that circulates within recent discussions of exhibitions and exhibition histories is that the most important aesthetic production of the 20th century is not found with objects, buildings or spaces, but within exhibitions themselves. Yet, there is a curious imbalance between the centrality claimed for exhibitions and their fugitive character. Exhibitions collect artifacts, exist briefly, and are then dispersed. The conference will address what we know of exhibitions through questions of archives, records, documents, and remains.<br />

The Manual for Bicycles in Businesses,Tuesday,12,November,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"Part of a series of lectures on bicycles, spurred by CicloRotas, a joint initiative by Studio-X Rio, ITDP and Transporte Ativo<br />
<br />
Businesses, people and the environment are directly affected by how we choose to move through the city. Improving traffic, reducing pollution and seeking quality of life depends on joint actions of government, businesses and citizens. &nbsp;Not only economic growth, but the quality of life in the city depends on a transportation system which is clean and efficient and benefits everyone.&nbsp; Prosperity and the economy are in our hands. The environment, quality of life and the health of people as well.<br />
<br />
The Manual for Bicycles in Businesses shows the benefits of cycling for organizations, encouraging its use by employees, and a step-by-step process to assemble a fleet of bikes, and what is needed to innovate a supply chain management, aiming not only to save resources but to be sustainable as well.<br />
Changes in behavior can have a positive impact on the economy of enterprises and people&#39;s lives.&nbsp; Encouraging employees to go cycling from home to work can save time and money for both the employer and for the employee. Using bikes for services and delivery of documents and cargo not only contributes to greater efficiency of the logistics of business as well as improves the air we breathe.<br />
<br />
The manual shows, in 4 chapters, that inserting the bicycle on the transport policy of a company is the right type of investment, motivating a healthy work environment and demonstrating social, financial and corporate responsibility.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

Journalist: GSAPP Exhibitions presents Adolf Loos: Our Contemporary,Tuesday,12,November,2013,Core Series,Core Series,"<strong>Beatriz Colomina,</strong> Princeton University, <strong>Hermann Czech,</strong> Atelier Czech, <strong>Pedro Gadanho,</strong> Musuem of Modern Art, and <strong>Yehuda Safran,</strong> GSAPP<br />
<br />
<em>Adolf Loos: Our Contemporary</em> celebrates the centenary of the Looshaus in&nbsp;Vienna and the publication of Adolf Loos&rsquo; most&nbsp;provocative theoretical text:&nbsp;<em>Ornament and Crime</em>. Its primary aim is to map some significant reactions to&nbsp;Loos both among his closest followers, like Paul Engelmann, and more distant&nbsp;admirers such as Ernesto Rogers and Aldo Rossi. The exhibition centers around a series of interviews with major contemporary figures on the international scene including Hans Hollein, Hermann Czech, Alvaro Siza, Eduardo Souto de Moura, Jacques Herzog, Paulo Mendes da Rocha, Toyo Ito, David Adjaye, Steven Holl, and Preston Scott Cohen. From the moment of its appearance Loos&rsquo; cultural criticism never failed to elicit controversy and outrage. Couched in the language of his day, it reads as a polemic from another era that nonetheless continues to hold its own. One of chief objectives of the exhibition is to capture the uncanny sense of contemporaneity that Loos exerts, often in the most unobtrusive ways.<br />

GSAPP is pleased to announce the relaunch of the Arthur Ross Architecture Gallery. Its expansion and renovation were made possible with generous support from the <strong>Arthur Ross Foundation</strong>.<br />

<strong>19:30 Exhibition Opening:&nbsp; Collecting Architectural Territories</strong><br />
One of the most significant developments reshaping the intersection of art and architectural practice over the last three decades is the veritable explosion of institutions and foundations that have emerged out of private art collections. Collecting Architecture Territories is a research, and teaching project that attempts to assess the breadth and diversity of such institutions&ndash;they range from experimental new museums to renovated industrial, commercial, or military buildings&ndash;and to map the effects of these institutions on conventional museological practices and forms of collecting. A salient feature of these foundations and art centers is their wide geographic distribution. They are often located far from the historical centers of power, operating across a new constellation of global cities, and increasingly, a range of &ldquo;non-sites.&rdquo; One of the central hypotheses of the research is that we are presently witnessing a shift in the historical relationship between architecture and collecting practices, one that inherited conceptions of the museum no longer adequately describe.<br />

Its forms are made of wavy glass and alternating shades of red sandstone that were patterned according to the four-color theorem, as well as context-specific ornamentation: the museum&rsquo;s exterior is decorated with 3,000 metallic hands that pay homage to the city&rsquo;s coat of arms and apocryphal founding myth as a city of &ldquo;hand werpen&rdquo; or &ldquo;hand throwing,&rdquo; while the interior is adorned with 3,000 manhole-inspired medallions that feature a poem about the its defining feature, water, to weave together building, place, and civic identity.<br />

<strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
<br />
The city, as it is; is an eclectic collage of superposed states; it involves overlapping images of co-existing urban situations. Both the physical existence of the city as a built texture and the social geography of urbanity form a superposed morphology. Cairo&rsquo;s &ldquo;city of the dead&rdquo; is a significant example of this urban superposition, where two very distinct states of existence overlap each other, an extraordinary coexistence of life and death. Cairo&#39;s &quot;city of the dead&quot; is partly a cemetery, with its monumentality and sacredness, and partly a vibrant city quarter with around one million dwellers living within its limits. For those who are not living in the &ldquo;city of the dead&rdquo;, it is a graveyard with inhabitants. For the inhabitants themselves, it is the city, an enactment of their being.<br />
<br />
The lecture will demonstrate thoroughly the unique case of Cairo&rsquo;s &quot;city of the dead&quot;, its founding and evolution. Moataz Faissal Farid will analyze the larger context where it lies, the city growth around it, the cultural and religious traditions of burial in Egypt, and how all this affected the life and the architecture inside the &quot;city of the dead&quot;, and finally it will question the validity of various ideas and ongoing development projects in the area.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Biography:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>MOATAZ FAISSAL FARID</strong> (born 1983 in Cairo, Egypt) studied architecture in Ain Shams University in Cairo Egypt, and in the Politecnico di Milano in Italy. He collaborated with &#39;Archplan&#39; studio and &#39;Dar-al Handasah&#39; company in Cairo during the period from 2005 until 2007. He is currently living and working in Milan, where he is collaborating since 2008 with the international architectural studio &#39;Stefano Boeri Architetti&#39;. He exhibited his work in 2008 at the Egyptian National pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture, with the project &lsquo;Shadow of Geometry&rsquo; curated by Tarek Waly. In 2011, he co-founded &#39;Zawia&#39;, an English &amp; Arabic publication and series of events on architecture, design &amp; urbanism, published in Egypt and distributed internationally. Together with the Zawia team, they organized two discussion panels and volume presentation in Linke Lab in Milan and in Megawra Hub in Cairo. He collaborated with &lsquo;Magaz Magazine&rsquo; as a contributing writer since August 2010, a magazine on design and architecture published in Cairo, Egypt. He participated in a research project titled &lsquo;900 Km Nile City&rsquo; with the &lsquo;Berlage Institute&rsquo; in 2013, and together with Pier Paolo Tamburelli he edited a book with the same title, it was published in Cairo in February 2013. He also co-curated an exhibition for the same project together with Amr Abdelkawi, and moderated a discussion panel held at the &lsquo;Townhouse Gallery&rsquo; in Cairo in the same period.<br />

Very Large Organizations: Exhibition,Friday,1,November,2013,Exhibition,Studio-X,"This exhibition introduces architect Jordan Geiger&#39;s design research on the spaces of &quot;Very Large Organizations (VLOs).&quot; Today, human-computer interactions in the built environment are marked by the rapid development of VLOs: new formations of global financial, legal, and communications networks, abrupt social and environmental events, and more. VLOs operate on multiple scales from the nano to the human to the extra-planetary. They are present in the designs of handheld devices, satellite networks, and the built landscapes we inhabit in between. The planning and implementation for VLOs command logistics, capital, and an order of population magnitude that must accommodate volatile shifts with spatial and computational stability. Adaptability is at the crux of dealing with diverse users or publics and unprecedented technical, cultural, social, and ecological challenges; and it is where control can give way to engagement and participation.<br />
<br />
The show is an overview of several VLOs and how they present a potent new field for design. Work is documented graphically and presented on flags as sovereign entities, a &quot;Hall of VLOs.&quot; The exhibition features a special text by <a href=""http://javier.est.pr"">Javier Arbona</a>.<br />

9:20 am<strong> Address: Tech and the City: The Long View</strong><br />
James Sanders, AIA<br />
Project Director and Conference Organizer<br />
Principal, James Sanders + Associates, and CURE. Senior Fellow<br />
<br />
This opening address will establish several themes of the conference<br />
by exploring the historic relationship between great cities &ndash; above all,<br />
New York &ndash; and technological innovation, especially in the area of<br />
telecommunications, information, and media. In the recent explosion<br />
in the digital industry in New York, and in its striking attraction to a<br />
classically dense urban environment &ndash; utterly distinct from the<br />
suburban-oriented growth of Silicon Valley &ndash; can be seen the<br />
rebirth of a culture of urban tech innovation, whose roots stretch<br />
back to the 19th century.<br />
<br />
10:00 am <strong>Panel 1: The Rise of an Urban Digital Cultur</strong>e<br />
This panel will provide an introduction to the day&rsquo;s program by<br />
looking in broad terms at the sudden (and largely unexpected)<br />
emergence of New York&rsquo;s tech industry over the past decade, and<br />
its complex relationship with &ndash; and orientation to &ndash; the distinctive<br />
urban character of the city. It will explore the ways in which the<br />
rise of new tech-driven communities &ndash; which have developed<br />
around a complex mix of live/work uses, high-quality data<br />
infrastructure, a rich layer of urban amenity, and a decided<br />
preference for older, smaller, more idiosyncratic structures<br />
over large, conventional &ldquo;modern&rdquo; office buildings &ndash; have already<br />
begun to change the urban fabric of the city, and carry profound<br />
implications for its future.<br />

11:15 am <strong>Panel 2: Accelerator: The New Urban Workplace</strong><br />
Among the most evident ways in which digital culture is transforming<br />
city life is in the rapid emergence of new kinds of tech-oriented<br />
workplaces, and, more generally, of new ways of working in the city.<br />
This panel, comprised of some of the leading designers and developers<br />
of these new spaces, will explore the different type of new workplace<br />
models &ndash; including &ldquo;coworking,&rdquo; &ldquo;incubator&rdquo; and &ldquo;accelerator&rdquo; spaces&ndash; that<br />
are reshaping basic notions of the layout and structure of the urban office.<br />
The panel will also explore the ways in which these interior spaces interact<br />
with the larger urban environment &ndash; including such classic public settings<br />
as cafes, hotel lobbies, parks, and plazas &ndash; to turn the city itself into a kind<br />
of vast, seamless, indoor-outdoor workspace.<br />

1:45 pm <strong>Panel 3: The Wired and Wireless City: Challenges and Opportunities</strong><br />
This panel will look at what might be considered the basic foundation blocks<br />
for &ldquo;building the digital city,&rdquo; by examining the significance of data infrastructure<br />
to urban development and redevelopment. From the starting point of the<br />
(still-emerging) understanding that in the 21st century digital access has become as<br />
essential to urban life as electricity, gas, water, and sewerage, the panel will look at the<br />
current challenges in providing broadband access within existing urban areas<br />
(and its impact on growth), at the emerging possibilities for digitally propelled<br />
&ldquo;smart development,&rdquo; and at new initiatives to create a standardized, widely<br />
adopted digital certification program for buildings and developments, equivalent<br />
to LEED.<br />

Work and Workplaces in the Digital City: The Emerging Technology Workplace in New York City<br />
Andrew Laing</strong><br />
Global Practice Lead, AECOM, and Senior Fellow, CURE.<br />
<br />
Technology and patterns of work are resetting expectations for what the future<br />
workplace should provide. The tech sector plays a unique role both as a<br />
creator of products that enable new ways of working, and as a pioneer of<br />
new kinds of workplaces. In New York, the sector thrives in the city&rsquo;s dense<br />
collaborative culture that re-mixes how technology and space can be used.<br />
Flexible and mobile ways of working are enabling new concepts of workplace.<br />
Three models are identified: Co-working, Open House, and Co-Habiting.<br />
Technology is also enabling new ways of providing space: workplace as a<br />
service and collaborative consumption. Propositions for the future tech<br />
workplace are highlighted.<br />
<br />
3:30 pm <strong>Afternoon coffee break</strong><br />
<br />
3:40 pm <strong>Panel 4: The New Tech District and the Changing Cit</strong>y<br />
This panel, comprised of leaders in tech-oriented real-estate and<br />
collaborative workspace development in New York, will look at the<br />
emergence and significance of the new tech districts in the city, and discuss<br />
how and where existing growth can be sustained and encouraged<br />
in the next decade. It will also explore the long-term implications for<br />
New York&rsquo;s development and transportation patterns &ndash; as new tech<br />
clusters in Brooklyn and Queens challenge the city&rsquo;s historic &ldquo;hub-and-spoke&rdquo;<br />
orientation to its midtown central business district, in favor of an<br />
emerging multi-centered urban network.<br />

Work and Workplaces in the Digital City: The Emerging Technology Workplace in New York City<br />
Andrew Laing</strong><br />
Global Practice Lead, AECOM, and Senior Fellow, CURE.<br />
<br />
Technology and patterns of work are resetting expectations for what the future<br />
workplace should provide. The tech sector plays a unique role both as a<br />
creator of products that enable new ways of working, and as a pioneer of<br />
new kinds of workplaces. In New York, the sector thrives in the city&rsquo;s dense<br />
collaborative culture that re-mixes how technology and space can be used.<br />
Flexible and mobile ways of working are enabling new concepts of workplace.<br />
Three models are identified: Co-working, Open House, and Co-Habiting.<br />
Technology is also enabling new ways of providing space: workplace as a<br />
service and collaborative consumption. Propositions for the future tech<br />
workplace are highlighted.<br />

The Architecture of Friday Mosques: Doctrinal Discourses and the Evolution of Architectural Paradigms,Tuesday,29,October,2013,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"The current archaeological and art historical study of mosques focuses mainly on building typology and architectural style. Mosques are generally understood within a broad rubric that is divided into two main types: Friday mosques (jami&lsquo;) that are distinguished by the presence of a minbar, an impressive size, and elaborate architecture and decoration; and regular neighbourhood mosques (masjid) that are seen to be functional in purpose and small in size. In addition, the relationship between architectural patronage, visual symbolism, and political power continue to be the most prevalent theme of critical analysis for mosque architecture. The use of the mosque by worshipers and the social and symbolic value they derived from it and instilled in it throughout its history as an institution is not central to the current debate. Nor, for that matter, is the relationship between prayer and mosques.<br />
<br />
Jacob Lassner (1967), Oleg Grabar (1969) and Ernest Hertzfeld (1942-48) have at times raised questions related to the function of the mosque and probed its meaning in a given city. Yet these questions seem not to have generated further art historical interest and were subsumed in the more current concern for issues of style and patronage. As a result, the fact that the Great Umayyad mosque of Damascus remained the only Friday mosque in the city until the establishment of the Hanbalite mosque in the Salihiyya quarter in the early thirteenth century, or the well attested to limited number of Friday mosques in Muslim cities prior to the Ottoman period, for example, remained unquestioned. If we understand the Friday mosques to be the central emblem of Muslim religiousity, how can we explain their sporadic presence in Muslim medieval cities?<br />
<br />
Mosque architecture itself is not the focus of Muslim historical discourse, yet a broad range of legal, historical, and didactic textual sources dealing with prayer in general, and the Friday prayer in particular, provide a valuable insight into how mosques were perceived and used. This rich textual discourse is the focus of this paper with the purpose of re-examining the paradigmatic understanding of mosque architecture and the evolution of its meaning and function. Taking a longue duree approach and a broad geographical perspective, the paper will examine Friday mosques in specific contexts and the textual discourse relevant to them highlighting the issues, concerns and principles involved in the Muslim understanding of the Friday prayer and the Friday mosques, and broadening the art historical debate about them.<br />
<br />
Ruba Kana&rsquo;an is the Head of Education and Scholarly Programmes at the Aga Khan Museum, Toronto. She is a specialist on the urban histories of pre-modern Muslim societies, and the interface between art and law in Muslim contexts. She has a BSc. in architecture (Jordan 1987), and an MPhil and a DPhil in Islamic art and architecture from Oxford University (UK 1993 and 1998). She has taught extensively at the graduate and undergraduate levels on various aspects of Islamic art and architecture (7th &ndash;19th centuries) and comparative approaches to Middle Eastern at Oxford University (UK), and York University (Toronto). In 2007 she developed, wrote and taught Oxford University&rsquo;s first on-line course in Islamic Art and Architecture.<br />
<br />
She has undertaken a number of academic research projects including a study of institutions of architectural patronage in Ottoman Palestine including the waqf, and the manner in which pre-modern Muslim societies created civic space. This research formed the basis of two articles published in the journals Levant (2001) and Muqarnas (2001). Her research has also taken her to Oman where she carried out a comprehensive survey of Oman&rsquo;s historical mosques focussing on their socio-legal development and artistic influences.&nbsp; An important aspect of this survey concerning the uniquely decoratedmihrabs of Ibadhi mosques is published in Islamic Art in Oman (2008). Most recently, her interest in the confluence between art and law in Muslim contexts has lead to the re-assessment of the relationship between artist and patron in medieval Muslim societies. In this instance, she has carried out a study of the production and patronage of pre-Mongol metalwork in Iran and Central Asia, here examining evidence from medieval compendiums of contract law and artists&rsquo; signatures (Islamic Law and Society 2009; Ars Orientalis 2012).",New York,"200, Fayerweather"

Dialogue Architecture,Monday,28,October,2013,Exhibition Opening,Studio-X,"According to Juan Herreros, technical culture forms a common ground that<br />
<br />
is crucial to architecture. This culture is formed from the dialogue between<br />
<br />
colleagues, experts, and consultants across a wide range of specialisms. Reflecting<br />
<br />
this, Herreros presents a selection of architectural forms, construction details,<br />
<br />
and organizational charts, originally displayed at the 13th Venice International<br />
<br />
Architecture Exhibition, last year. These are presented in the abstract, displayed<br />
<br />
with no references to the buildings from which they are drawn. The deliberate<br />
<br />
intention is to open an unbiased dialogue&mdash;the &ldquo;what,&rdquo; &ldquo;how,&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of these<br />
<br />
projects&mdash;that can be used by third parties as the start of further explorations.<br />
<br />
The architect is not interested in the fascination for technology or unnecessary<br />
<br />
complexities. Instead, he proposes that &ldquo;technical thinking&rdquo; allows one to make<br />
<br />
decisions and to identify what might be superfluous. &ldquo;The construction of the<br />
<br />
immediate future requires the cooperative coexistence of initiatives from private<br />
<br />
individuals alongside those of the community,&rdquo; says Herreros. &ldquo;This community<br />
<br />
will no longer be formed only by architects and construction designers but, on the<br />
<br />
contrary, will be enriched with contributions from those who occupy and share<br />
<br />
these spaces day by day. The first consequence of this expansion and infiltration<br />
<br />
of architecture into other disciplines will be the recovery of its role as a social<br />
<br />
practice involved in the changes that really matter.&rdquo; This approach transforms a<br />
<br />
contemporary project into a rich assembly of skills, abilities, and knowledge. It<br />
<br />
brings the old idea of teamwork up to date in order to convert a design process<br />
<br />
more and more into a research program. Herreros suggests that &ldquo;technical thinking&rdquo;<br />
<br />
is also a reference system and a vehicle to understand the past and visit the future.<br />
<br />
It is a critical resource that has yet to be fully exploited when it comes to reading,<br />
<br />
interpreting, describing, and acting responsibly on a troubled and uncontrolled<br />
<br />
reality.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
Aerial Arts: Networks in Post-Blitz London,Thursday,24,October,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"Join us for an evening of deliberate redundancies and alternate routes at Studio-X NYC, as Annette Fierro, Associate Professor of Architecture at Penn Design, explores architectural paths in the shadow of the Blitz. As one of a series of public events accompanying artist <a href=""http://events.gsapp.org/event/aerial-arts-exhibition"">Meg Studer&rsquo;s <em>Aerial Arts </em>exhibit</a>, Fierro&#39;s examination of aerial anxieties focuses on the notion of circulation, its wartime inversion (i.e. Tube- sheltering), and its post-war proliferation at the scale of civic architectures and cumulative urban forms.<br />
<br />
Post-war visionary architecture in London instigated redundant systems of movement and circulation that ultimately disintegrated into disjunctive overlays, networks &ldquo;erased&rdquo; into fabric. Exploring this sensibility, toward&nbsp;<em>frayed</em>&nbsp;networks, Annette will examine the great realized works of post-war London architecture: the Barbican and Southbank Centre.<br />

Beast or Beauty? How to Adapt a Brutalist Building in Six Easy Moves,Tuesday,22,October,2013,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"<div>
	The Southbank Centre, famed for its audacious brutalist architecture, occupies a magical position in the heart of London, England. It sits in a curve of the River Thames, with views of the Houses of Parliament to the west and St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral to the east. It is one of the most beautiful spots in London which elicits a deep intake of breath whatever the weather, whatever the time of day. The cultural significance of the Southbank Arts Centre is undisputed: the Queen Elizabeth Hall is unrivalled as a concert venue while the Hayward Art Gallery attracts international shows from Matisse, to Picasso to Henry Moore. But the buildings themselves have been controversial since their completion in 1968 when they were dubbed &ldquo;the disappearance of architecture&rdquo;. Today they are loved and loathed in equal measure and remain a symbol of 1960s rebellion with their introverted volumes, their tough materials and uncompromising geometries.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	They offer a bewildering but intriguing topography of concrete, a mound of buildings that provide a series of terraces and escarpments. They celebrate the idea that the structure of a building and its ductwork encased in concrete could form a new language of architectural form. The buildings continue to question our polite sensibilities about what a cultural building ought to be. But, nearly 50 years later, these audacious experiments in structure and material are in dire need of repair. Some of the ideas on which they were based have been discredited and many of their rebellious ideas have been tamed. Today, the Southbank Centre needs more space to do more art for more people. As architects appointed to lead a major refurbishment and extension of these iconic buildings, our first challenge is to repair them. The second is to introduce a whole new layer of architectural intervention. How do we go about bringing together these ambivalent and contested voices from the recent past with the voices of our contemporary culture? How do we adapt space conceived along specific functional and ideological lines to work for a new ideology and better function? Using archive and contemporary film footage, design drawings and visualisations Clare Hughes, Partner at London architecture firm Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios will tell the tale of &ldquo;Beast or Beauty: How to Adapt a Brutalist Building in Six Easy Moves.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	Clare Hughes MSc Arch.Cons.<br />
	After a successful career making films at the BBC in London, Clare retrained to work in Historic Building Conservation and&nbsp;Regeneration. Much of her work involves understanding and telling stories, expressing the heart of an architectural space&nbsp;through film, written word and curated experience. She joined FCBS in 2002 to work on their historic building and&nbsp;regeneration portfolio and has since become a partner due to the unusual combination of skills she brings.</div>

Sonja Duempelman is Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Her book, <em>Flights of Imagination: Powered Aviation and the Art and Science of Landscape Design and Planning</em>, is currently in press (UVA Press, 2014). She will begin the evening&rsquo;s events with a short talk, &ldquo;Camouflaging Camouflage,&rdquo; showing how the nature and politics of camouflage measures during WWII led to &ldquo;protective concealment&rdquo; being understood as a type of regional planning and landscape architecture, as well as how this method of strategic warfare continued to inform landscape design in the postwar years.&nbsp;<br />

An x-ray look at <a href=""http://www.rex-ny.com/work/vakko-fashion-center/#"">one building</a> by key players in its realization. The Vakko Fashion Center, a 40,000 square-foot headquarters for the Turkish fashion house <a href=""http://www.vakko.com/"">Vakko</a> and its related media company, which was completed in 2012, began in Southern California, with REX&rsquo;s design for a new building at Caltech. A sudden change in the school&rsquo;s administration halted plans and freed them up for a new client in Istanbul, Vakko, which needed a new home within one year. In this unusual story, construction began merely four days after REX received the commission, with plans quickly altered to include offices, showrooms, conference rooms, an auditorium, museum, and dining hall, as well as television studios, radio production facilities and a screening hall around the existing concrete skeleton of a former hotel&mdash;a striking building-within-a-building that exemplifies quick thinking and adaptive reuse.<br />

<br />
Once a bohemian center, the West Village has long lost itself to its own charm. And like Istanbul, the neighborhood adheres to no grid system. <em>Subjective Contours</em> aims to explore its present state, reveling in the neighborhood&#39;s unintentional geometry and flattening out its space via framing, drawing, and performing. Visual artists <strong>Hayal Pozanti </strong>(Turkey) and <strong>Todd Shalom</strong> (USA) will lead participants in reimagining plans for the neighborhood. This walk holds 12 people and will be held in English, though Hayal also speaks Turkish.<br />

Synth City,Saturday,12,October,2013,Performance,Studio-X,"<strong>Synth City</strong> consists of a two day session where six music producers from across the city are invited to create, discover and explore synths and their ability to express spaces or localities within the city.<br />
Individual localities or themed areas are assigned to each of the producers to interpret independently. The final project will consist of a synthesis of the various sounds into one holistic synth on Mumbai.&nbsp;It is an investigation of computer music, sonic space and&nbsp;generative art. The explorations are rooted in academic sound research as well as in club culture.<br />
<br />
The developing process in this work is part of an artistic production and the documentation through experience of spaces, objects, photographs and videos culminates into a&nbsp;sensitive memory of the work.<br />

	Aerial strikes! Imminent attack! Global war!</h2>
This exhibition of new work by designer <a href=""http://the-distopians.com/siteations/"">Meg Studer</a> explores Air-Age cartography, Arctic geopolitics, and their critique in 60s post-minimal art.<br />
<br />
Infographic boards and mid-century maps chart the polar projections, oblique &#39;over-views,&#39; and immersive maps shared between (civil) defense discourses and the &#39;Aerial Arts&#39; of Robert Smithson, Walter de Maria, et. al.<br />
<br />
In drawing out their cartographic response to space (and arms) race rhetoric, the show traverses a moment of global, intimate, and militarized mapping that resonates with our own.<br />

<strong>NYC 2040: Housing the Next One Million New Yorkers<br />
Jesse M. Keenan, Vishaan Chakrabarti</strong><br />
<br />
NYC 2040: Housing the Next One Million New Yorkers examines the physical and equitable implications of housing future generations of New York City residents. Using simulations to measure both the quantitative and qualitative implications of development, authors Keenan and Chakrabarti test a working hypothesis that certain zones within NYC have the potential for hyper-urbanized development, with greater levels of density and intensity of use. The research presented in this book attempts to provide an empirical platform for informing design, planning, and development decisions for the future of housing in New York. Join Keenan and Chakrabarti at Van Alen Books to celebrate the new release.<br />

Aerial Arts: Opening Reception,Thursday,10,October,2013,Opening,Studio-X,"Join us for the opening reception of <a href=""http://events.gsapp.org/event/aerial-arts-exhibition-october-11-25"">Aerial Arts: Defense Discourses, Cartographic Critiques</a>, a new exhibition now on display at Studio-X NYC. With the advent of Google Maps and mobile geo-location, most genealogies of our current intimate and often aerial embrace of cartography begin with Apollo 8 and the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em> of the late 1960s. This exhibition of new work by designer <a href=""http://the-distopians.com/siteations/"">Meg Studer</a> explores the era&#39;s wider artistic appropriations, tracing shared cartographic forms back further in time, to the Air-Age media campaigns of World War II and the Cold War, when polar maps and oblique &#39;over-views&#39; cast the world as a closed, continuous, and shrinking sphere, emphasizing &lsquo;flight-line&rsquo; proximity and U.S. vulnerability to German and, later, Soviet aerial attack.<br />
<br />
Oscillating from 1941 to 1967-69, the show uses infographic boards, period reprints, and mid-century objects to draw out the links between Air-Age maps, defense campaigns, and artistic critique.<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://the-distopians.com/siteations/"">Meg Studer</a> will provide a brief introduction to the exhibition during the reception; wine and snacks will be served. Free and open to the public; no RSVP necessary.<br />

Design Intelligence: Africa 3.0 - Trading Stories ,Wednesday,9,October,2013,[object Object],Studio-X,"DI:A 3.0 - Trading Stories will feature a public conversation with artists, architects, planners, scholars, and activists about how networks of mobility and trading impact Johannesburg&rsquo;s residents and its changing urban character. The evening will include the premiere public screening of three videos created by participants in Global Africa Lab&rsquo;s (GAL) Summer Workshop 2013 on Mobility and Trade: Data, Media Race + Space.<br />
<br />
GAL&rsquo;s three-week workshop brought together students and faculty from South Africa and the United States in collaboration with local activists, street traders, artists, architects, geographers, and urbanists. The workshop&rsquo;s participants utilised techniques of data spatialisation, ethnography, and digital video to research and document the dynamic streetscape of Bree Street, a major trading and informal transportation corridor in inner city Johannesburg. Unregulated street trade, as it is in many other African cities, is constituted by a range of urban actors, who collaborate across a wide range of networks, connections, and global assemblages. These flexible, mobile, and provisional intersections of residents and users often operate within, across, and against established infrastructures of control that challenge our understandings of how the city is inhabited and used. The workshop&rsquo;s exuberant and insightful videos illuminate the art of public life, the synergies between informal and formal, and the politics of movement and resistance in the commercial and domestic spaces of Bree Street.<br />

Translation: Making Roadways into Markets in New York City,Tuesday,8,October,2013,LiPS,LiPS,"Planners are increasingly involved in making markets &ndash;for carbon, for parking and for roadway congestion.&nbsp; Using congestion pricing advocacy in New York City as an example, this talk theorizes the political work that planners, advocacy groups and local governments do when they make markets. I argue that the politics of markets are interior to the process of making them.&nbsp; Markets are not definitive things with embedded politics. They are the result of an assemblage of particular people, technologies and ideas. With this in mind, I use the concept of&nbsp; translation, from Actor-network Theory to identify three important moments in market making: 1) materializing a metaphor; 2) modeling states of the world; and 3) mobilizing publics. The talk expands on the political work that planners do at each of these moments.<br />

In its own political and soci-economic background, China has developed its own planning approach since P.R. China was founded in 1949. China is also considered as the largest testing field of new planning theories. The rapid process of urbanization of the country also arose varies planning issues, especially in the field of historical preservation and land ownerships. For example, Hutong and Siheyuan Yards in Beijing were forced to give way to modern development.&nbsp;It seems China has been developed too fast to keep up with the pace. Is this true?

<br />
The question of representation in architecture once pitted architects against one another through heated debates as the field experienced post-modern thinking&rsquo;s nested waves. Today, it is rarely discussed even as the globalized faith in the Iconic and the possibility of its intended meaning continues unabashed. In the Middle East in particular, the proliferation of references to the mythical &lsquo;Traditional Islamic City&rsquo; or to the innocence of a nomadic past (as well as the default and random use of arched openings and geometric patterned surfaces) has rendered representation &lsquo;lazy&rsquo;. At a critical time of instability, anxiety and change, it seems important that Architecture re-engages the question of representation with the seriousness and complexity that it deserves.<br />
<br />
By addressing the broad notion of representation in architecture through the participants&#39; research and practice (in Amman, Beirut, Cairo, or Jerusalem), we aim to present a rich and diverse set of issues to be developed further in future steps of this initiative. The notion of representation in architecture translates into ideas on narratives, images, and political agency (or invisibility), and their role in the conception, fabrication, destruction and interpretation of the built environment (or of its spectral remains).<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Architecture and Representation&rdquo; is a public symposium organized by the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation&rsquo;s (GSAPP) Studio-X Amman at the Columbia Global Centers | Middle East as part of a design studio taught by Amale Andraos (Assistant Professor of Architecture at GSAPP).<br />

<br />
The book raises theoretical assumptions and methodologies about theories of intervention in architectural heritage, as well as comparative case studies, national and international, that come close to the questions and problems encountered in the task of completing an unfinished building of great historical, cultural and architectural heritage.<br />
<br />
The construction of the theater at the Museum of Modern Art (MAM) in Rio de Janeiro, finally completed five decades after it was first conceived, raises innumerable questions about how one might proceed in a challenge of this size.<br />
<br />
Planned by the architect Affonso Eduardo Reidy, the museum and the theater - situated in the Parque do Flamengo - had its last portion adapted to a situation distinct from the original in accordance with the specific contingencies that led to the theater being built.&nbsp; The aforementioned reflection on the various hypotheses of intervention that the situation raises and the exposition of differences between the original work, the approved project and its execution, is included in this book&rsquo;s objectives.<br />

What role should economic policy and technological innovation play in our thinking about energy? Are green building metrics such as LEED and ASHRAE still relevant? Are digital simulations and new building systems influencing our capacity to handle new challenges? How will we test out and scale up new solutions? What are the interdependencies between energy-efficient buildings, urban infrastructure, and natural ecosystems?<br />
<br />
In this daylong conversation, leading thinkers and practitioners will grapple with these and other pressing questions related to the future of energy. They will describe their work with passive cooling systems, free-flow tidal power, offshore algae farms, abandoned petrochemical sites, geothermal energy, and the relationship of energy to the developing world. They also will explore how major shifts in technology can trickle down, and how incremental and personal changes can scale up. And finally, they will present new applications and definitions related to energy, and consider how these developments today may lay the foundation for imagining change in realms of energy production and consumption tomorrow.<br />

Soviet Secrets in Transition: Heterotopias of the Cold War,Tuesday,1,October,2013,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"<div>
	Nameless, not shown on maps, Soviet Secret Cities (ZATO) were sites of highly secretive military and scientific research and production. Inspired by ideal cities, based on perfect geometric plans, articulated by progressive modernist architectural language, these sites were representing the most updated ideology of the Party. Foucaulian HETEROTOPIA as a concept of &ldquo;human geography&rdquo;, the best describes these spaces of otherness, which &ldquo;are neither here nor there, that are simultaneously physical and mental, such as the space of a phone call itself or the moment when you see yourself in the mirror&rdquo;. Today there are 43 ZATO on the territory of Russian Federation. Their future is uncertain: some may survive; other may disappear as urban formations within the context of Russian suburbs. It may happen that their existence will be no longer a metaphor, nor a fact. Using recently declassified archival materials, previously unknown documents, oral history, images, and interviews, Dr. Vytuleva render visible this phenomenon that created &nbsp;a new topography on the Soviet social, political, and urban landscape as well as the strategies of its preservation.</div>

Dr. Vytuleva has curated a number of exhibitions, including IMMaterial Box (Schusev State Museum of Architecture, Moscow), Moscow Planetarium &rsquo;99 (Moscow), Music on Bones (MAXXI, Rome), and most recently, Soviet Secret Cities during the Cold War (Columbia University).

<strong>Reem Fadda, </strong>Associate Curator, Middle Eastern Art, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Project<br />
<strong>Mark Wasiuta,</strong> Columbia University GSAPP<br />
<br />
At the core of <em>The Keeper</em> are more than 2,000 photographs that artist Shuruq Harb inherited in 2010. They are the remnants of a vast archive assembled by Mustafa, a young image entrepreneur who collected photographs online, to be printed for sale on the streets of Ramallah. Mustafa positioned himself as an intermediary between the explosive proliferation of photographs on the internet and an audience eager to participate in a form of image consumption otherwise unavailable to them. Acting as a content filter, he selected and composed a catalogue of Turkish soap opera stars, political figures, wrestlers, militants, musicians and other characters that would appeal to his clientele. Printed on the glossy stock of automatic photo labs, the images pivot between online spaces of frictionless circulation and zones of infrastructural limitation that would normally block their dissemination.<br />
<br />
Harb&#39;s project encounters the dilemma posed by this collection whose ephemeral value was hinged to the rapid temporality of news cycles and popular taste. The Keeper tangles with the fading currency, aura and celebrity of the figures portrayed and questions what is preserved within this archive extracted from the flux of a digital image economy.<br />

Between Architecture and Landscape,Saturday,28,September,2013,Exhibition Opening,Studio-X,"Concurrent with the opening of his new intervention, 2 Sculptures, in Pra&ccedil;a Tiradentes, an exhibition of Eduardo Coimbra&acute;s works will also open at Studio-X Rio.&nbsp; Arranged in parallel sections - architecture and landscape - the exhibition presents projects that reveal the relationship between an environment and its observer.<br />
<br />
Between the limits of the real and the imaginary, the natural and the artificial, Eduardo Coimbra sets up a series of strategies which deal with form and shape, limits and points of view, surface and depth, to reconstruct and reframe the spaces in which we interact.<br />
<br />
The exhibition includes photographs and videos of his previous interventions in emblematic works of modern architecture (MEC, MAC and Pampulha), models and photographs of projects for public spaces, both realized and unrealized, and a series of collages entitled Asteroids.<br />
<br />
<strong>Eduardo Coimbra</strong><br />
Eduardo Coimbra began his artistic career in the early 1990&acute;s.&nbsp; During the past 15 years his projects have had a great proximity with architecture through habitable spaces. His field research, conceptualization and recreation of landscapes have produced photographic works, drawings, collages, installations in institutional spaces, models, and proposals for public spaces.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
The Waterline,Friday,27,September,2013,Presentation,Studio-X,"The project seeks to accommodate the ambiguous use of India&rsquo;s pipelines as well as addressing the water shortage problem in an attempt to merge protection, rainwater collection and public service. It is a parasite-infrastructure designed to support, preserve and enhance the existing water pipeline infrastructure. The vision is for the waterline to encourage growth and sustainability, with potential additions to the structure such as public bathrooms, showers, institutions (school, kindergarden, etc.). In the case of water pipe relocation, the lower space can be used as public space, housing, markets etc., or the structures can be relocated to other sites. Water shortage is part of a common global future, and Denmark as well as any other nation could make use of the waterline system to provide protection, access to free water and social gathering spaces.<br />

Architecture and Sustainability in Cities,Saturday,21,September,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"<br />
The CASA Institute, Studio-X Rio and the National Secretary of Housing, invite Robin Nicholson to present his work from CABE (the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment), case studies from the Cambridgeshire Quality Panel in England, as well as two projects on housing and community development in Libya and in London.<br />
<br />
CABE was created by the Labour Party in Britain after several years of crisis and of little public investment, in order to ensure quality and better use of resources in planned investments for housing, education, health and culture in the country. The function of CABE is to assist public institutions in becoming better prepared institutions, advising the construction and revision of more than 300 significant projects per year from 1999 to 2010, and defending actions in favor of the environment in the 8 Core English Cities.<br />
The Cambridgeshire Quality Panel was created to assess the quality of urban development in Cambridge, England and its environs, where 75,000 new jobs are being created and 73,000 new housings units are being constructed.<br />
The Stonebridge Orange Tree is a new housing venture, located in North West London, which will provide 117 mixed-tenure homes - some shared and some private - to be completed in the summer of 2015.<br />
The planning of a carbon-neutral garden city was also completed, from 2010-2011, in Shahat, Libya for an estimated 60,000 residents in an area of great urban blight, east of Benghazi.<br />
<br />
Robin Nicholson is a partner at Cullinan Studio, based in London, which he joined in 1979. He is the organizer of The Edge, an interdisciplinary think tank for the construction industry, and president of the Cambridgeshire Quality Panel. He is also a member of the National Council of Housing, and is one of the chairmen of CABE Design.<br />

A Country Of Cities,Thursday,19,September,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"In A Country of Cities, author Vishaan Chakrabarti argues that well-designed cities are the key to solving America&#39;s great national challenges: environmental degradation, unsustainable consumption, economic stagnation, rising public health costs and decreasing social mobility. If we develop them wisely in the future, our cities can be the force leading us into a new era of progressive and prosperous stewardship of our nation. In compelling chapters, Chakrabarti brings us a wealth of information about cities, suburbs and exurbs, looking at how they developed across the 50 states and their roles in prosperity and globalization, sustainability and resilience, and health and joy. Counter to what you might think, American cities today are growing faster than their suburban counterparts for the first time since the 1920s. If we can intelligently increase the density of our cities as they grow and build the transit systems, schools, parks and other infrastructure to support them, Chakrabarti shows us how both job opportunities and an improved, sustainable environment are truly within our means. In this call for an urban America, he illuminates his argument with one hundred illustrations that visualize important statistics on issues as disparate as the success and joy associated with city life, the health impacts of ever-lengthening automobile commutes, and government subsidies that encourage us to create sprawl rather than build tall. The book closes with an eloquent manifesto that rallies us to build &quot;a Country of Cities,&quot; to turn a country of highways, houses and hedges into a country of trains, towers and trees.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

<br />
&quot;Let us form a truly urban coalition, one that binds the need for economic prosperity, environmental stewardship, and social mobility with the one-stop shopping of transit-rich hyperdensity,&quot; urges Vishaan Chakrabarti in his recently released <a href=""http://metropolisbooks.com/books/new-releases/a-country-of-cities/""><em>A Country of Cities: A Manifesto for an Urban America</em></a>. In this conversation, voices from GSAPP consider the book&#39;s call to transform the United States from a country of &quot;highways, houses, and hedges&quot; into one of &quot;trains, towers, and trees&quot; alongside notions of the public and private sector. In the quest for density, who builds? And, what biases are revealed? Finally, what will be required of professionals of tomorrow, and how should they prepare for the rapidly changing social and political landscape described within the book&#39;s titular tract?<br />

Beyond North,Friday,13,September,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"In the imagination of the virtual visitor, both past and present, the Arctic often evokes romanticized scenarios on both sides of the utopian/dystopian discourse. In reality, the world&#39;s polar regions are sites of complex cultural, and ecological significance &mdash; particularly today, when their climate-changed landscapes are the subject of geopolitical and territorial conflicts, while at the same time posing new opportunities for transnational and intercultural cooperation.<br />
<br />
In this presentation we will explore a series of exercises that aim to generate a palette of understandings of this often surreal landscape, based on expeditions and experiences in the Arctic. From Greenland to Iceland, via Svalbard, students and practitioners have created devices and shelters in an effort to chart, record, map, or otherwise engage with the realities of a context that on the surface seems almost beyond architecture.<br />
<br />
The talk will be followed by a Q&amp;A and light refreshments. Free &amp; open to the public.<br />

Bicycle Urbanism by Design,Tuesday,10,September,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"As part of a series of lectures brought on by the exhibition Ciclo Rotas, currently<br />
on display at Studio-X Rio, &nbsp;we have invited&nbsp;Mikael Colville-Andersen to share&nbsp;<br />
his ideas with us.<br />
<br />
As an urban mobility expert and CEO for Copenhagenize Design Company,<br />
Mikael Colville-Andersen is one of the leading global voices in urban planning<br />
and he focuses on re-establishing the bicycle on the urban landscape. He<br />
regards the bicycle is the most important tool in our urban toolbox for rebuilding<br />
our liveable cities.<br />
<br />
Few people have done more to promote urban cycling than Colville-Andersen.<br />
What started with the now-famous &rdquo;Photo That Launched a Million Bicycles&rdquo;<br />
on Copenhagen Cycle Chic (copenhagencyclechic.com) that kickstarted the<br />
global bicycle boom, led to the bicycle urbanism blog Copenhagenize.com, The<br />
Slow Bicycle Movement, the global Cycle Chic trend, the Bicycle Innovation<br />
Lab (the first cultural centre for urban cycling) and even a Danish cycling NGO<br />
- Cykelrepublikken. Colville-Andersen has coined a number of expressions to<br />
describe this modern bicycle boom, including; Cycle Chic, Copenhagenize,<br />
Bicycle Urbanism and Citizen Cyclist.<br />
<br />
With his company, Colville-Andersen and his team advise cities and towns<br />
about how to gear up for Bicycle Culture 2.0 and take the bicycle seriously as<br />
transport once again. They work on a variety of projects, including putting the<br />
bicycle onto the curriculum in Sao Paulo schools, communications strategies<br />
aimed at encouraging Citizen Cyclists to consider the bicycle as transport and<br />
working with architectural firms in order to get the bicycle into the designs from<br />
the beginning of the process.<br />
<br />
In his Bicycle Urbanism by Design talk, Colville-Andersen will make you think<br />
differently about your city, your streets and, indeed, the very way Rio de Janeiro<br />
should be modernising itself for the future. He inspires and provokes with his<br />
original take on things. Indeed, he has been called &rdquo;Jane Jacobs with attitude&rdquo;.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
Resilience and Justice,Tuesday,10,September,2013,LiPS,LiPS,"Recently resilience seems to have displaced sustainability as the term encapsulating the aim of planners. The concept of resilience responds to the damage recently wrought by hurricanes and earthquakes, even while it is being stretched to encompass economic crisis and social misery. The question is whether, by using the term to cover so much, it obfuscates the trade-offs involved and the resulting distributions of costs and benefits. The issue then is whether by using this term we are, as with sustainability, seeking an innocuous label to justify controversial actions, or whether it can be used to mobilize a political force for achieving more just outcomes.<br />

Fixies,Tuesday,20,August,2013,Roundtable Discussion,Studio-X,"Fixed gear bicycles were developed before their freewheel counterparts, but more recently have become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists.

As the maintenance of a fixed gear bike is uncomplicated and inexpensive, they were adopted by bike messengers in big cities. A short time after, they began to be associated with young and urban cultural scene of &ldquo;hipsters&rdquo;.<br />

To do so, we will welcome the presence of the creator of the main group of fixie-cyclists in the city, Ciro Luporini, the co-founder of the first delivery by bike company in Rio, Naldinho, the bike polo player and long-distance cyclist, Beatriz Folly, and historian and enthisuast of the fixed gear bicycle, Renato Maia.<br />
<br />
Come join this conversation and learn more about this mode of transportation that is transforming the lifestyle of our city.<br />
<br />
Ciro Luporini<br />
Ciro is a businessman and his relationship with fixed gear bikes began when he was living in London. Upon his return to Rio, he brought his passion for fixies to the group RJFG, an organization of fixed gear riders in the city that has grown tremendously in recent years and has been (celeiro) of several initiatives.<br />
<br />
Naldinho<br />
Founding partner of Cycle Courier the first express package delivery company by bike in Rio, in which he also works as a deliveryman using a fixie to go through the city daily. He has also been named as the fifth best urban cyclist in the country in challenges from the Strava app.<br />
<br />
Renato Maia<br />
A PhD in information science, Renato has lived in Rio for ten years, where he has adopted the bike as his primary means of transportation. His fascination for fixies began a little more than three years ago, with a particular interest in the history of fixies, the reasons for its popularity and its impact on cities.<br />

Who Cares for Chilean cities? ,Friday,16,August,2013,Opening,Studio-X,"The exhibition &ldquo;Who Cares for Chilean cities? Answers from Architecture, Public Space and<br />
<br />
Urban Projects,&rdquo; was held at the Avery Hall of Columbia University in New York between March<br />
<br />
and April of 2013, as part of the event &ldquo;Chile at Columbia.&rdquo; This installment at Studio-X Rio is its<br />
<br />
second stop.<br />
<br />
The show accounts for the Chilean production in the fields of Architecture, Public Space and<br />
<br />
Urban Projects between 2007 and 2012, displaying 3 projects for each category selected by<br />
<br />
Guest Curators Rodrigo P&eacute;rez de Arce (Architecture), Romy Hecht (Public Space) and Luis<br />
<br />
Eduardo Bresciani (Urban Projects). The idea of the organizers Clara Iraz&aacute;bal and Alejandro<br />
<br />
De Castro, and the General Curator Francisco D&iacute;az, was creating an exhibition that would<br />
<br />
open up a discussion about Chilean cities through the responses that architects and planners<br />
<br />
have developed during the last five years in the southern country. In this way, the variety<br />
<br />
of responses received from the three guest curators helped to have a broader and critical<br />
<br />
understanding of the question of the city in a country whose cities seem to haven&rsquo;t benefited<br />
<br />
neither from the economic success of the country nor from a prodigal generation of architects.<br />
<br />
In this regard the question &ldquo;Who cares for Chilean cities?&rdquo; operated not only as an excuse for a<br />
<br />
conversation about the status of the contemporary city in Chile, but also as a call for attention to<br />
<br />
architects and planners.<br />
<br />
The exhibition is organized by the GSAPP Latin Lab of Columbia University, with the support<br />

"Slums in Architectural History,",Thursday,15,August,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"Slums, as considered by United Nations&rsquo; Millennium Development Goals, are the very urban manifestation of problems related to poverty and/or inequality. To respond to these intangible urban problems, architectural design has defined itself throughout many examples along the 20th century as a problem solving discipline. Yet, little effort has been placed on the historical sequence of urban planning programs and design practices that emerged in the 19th Century and have since evolved in methods and practices to address the challenges of informality. If architectural design can be understood as a discipline that solves urban problems through physical/spatial solutions: what is the history of those problems and their solutions? How is that history related to mainstream architectural history?<br />
<br />
This presentation makes use of the history of Photography to outline a historical sequence of paradigmatic global urban problems and architectural solutions at slums throughout the 20th century. Photographers include Thomas Annan, Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Bishop Marshall, Jonas Bendiksen, Andre Cypriano, Sebastiao Salgado, and Iwaan Ban. The evolution of urban problems at photographs will identify urban planning and architectural solutions such as slum clearance, social housing, incremental housing, and urban upgrading.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
How can I transform my city?,Tuesday,13,August,2013,Roundtable Discussion,Studio-X,"Rio de Janeiro is undergoing the challenging task of recuperating and revitalizing it&#39;s central area.&nbsp; Betting that the articulation between requalified public space and mobility at its small scale - pedestrians and bicycle lanes - has a fundamental role on the construction of a more sustainable and humane city, Studio-X Rio, ITDP Brasil and Transporte Ativo have initiated (since July of 2012) a mapping study on the demands of a cycle path network for Rio&#39;s downtown area.<br />

War & Peace of Kenzo Tange,Friday,9,August,2013,Lecture,Studio-X,"This session mainly focuses on Kenzo Tange&rsquo;s three early projects, namely, The Great Far Eastern Co-prospective Sphere Memorial Project in 1941,　Thai-Japanese Cultural Center in Bangkok Project in 1943, and Hiroshima Peace Center in 1951, as well as their backgrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
1, The Great Far Eastern Co-prospective Sphere Memorial Project in 1941<br />
<br />
In the focal point of Tange&rsquo;s The Great Far Eastern Co-prospective Sphere Memorial Project is there a pavilion, which is characteristic in its straight-lined Shinto shrine shape. This shape of shrine called &ldquo;Tenchi-Kongen Miyazukuri (cosmogonic shrine construction),&rdquo; had been posited as the origin of Japanese architecture by Hideto Kishida who was a historian at the date. Kishida was also Tange&rsquo;s mentor and later his father-in-law, and furthermore, a jury of the competition to which the project was submitted. At any rate, the focal point of the project strongly reflected Kishida&rsquo;s story and idea of Japanese architectural history.<br />
The project was also impressive in its strong axis road from Tokyo to the Tanzawa Mountains. This baroque automobile road, &ldquo;The Great Far Eastern Co-prospective Sphere Road,&rdquo; is deemed to mimic German Autobahn on one hand. At the terminus of the road is there a huge open space for the celebrations of the great far eastern co-prospective sphere. This huge open space for the celebrations is now deemed to mimic the open spaces for Nazi party celebration near Nurnberg in the 1930s. The terminus of the road is also pointing to Mt.Fuji.<br />
In a sense, we might say that this project was a populist icon amalgamating Japanese nationalism and Nazi party stages.<br />
<br />
2, Thai-Japanese Cultural Center in Bangkok Project in 1943<br />
<br />
Thai-Japanese Cultural Center in Bangkok Project was also for the competition. One of the juries of the competition was, again, Hideto Kishida. The project gained the first prize, and the second prized project was by Kunio Mayekawa.<br />
Ryuichi Hamaguchi, Tange&rsquo;s classmate at University of Tokyo, wrote an essay titled &ldquo;Problems of the style for Japanese People,&rdquo; which was dedicated both to Tange&rsquo;s project and to Mayekawa&rsquo;s as well in 1944.<br />
In this essay, Hamaguchi analyzed European building as solid and Japanese building as spatial. From the point of construction, the former is stereotomic, and the latter is tectonic, yet Hamaguchi introduced this analysis modifying Wilhelm Worringer&rsquo;s notion of Kunstwollen into his own notion of Bauwollen.<br />
Contrary to European solid buildings, characterizing Japanese buildings as spatial was,without saying, partly due to the fact that the essay was written at a time when Japan was under the war against some Western countries. However, this essay first characterized Japanese or Pacific Rim architecture in terms of space and/or object, not of the 19th century visual style.<br />
Furthermore, Hamaguchi introduced another important notion in the essay: environment. The project site was located in Bangkok, Thailand not in Japan because of wartime diplomacy, so that Tange, Mayekawa, Hamaguchi, and other architects participated the competition have had to consider the geological elements such as temperature, humidity, etc. In other words, they had to plan not only from the visual iconic viewpoint but also from invisible and environmental standpoint.<br />
<br />
3, Hiroshima Peace Center in 1951<br />
<br />
Hiroshima Peace Center project was planned after the end of war. Tange&rsquo;s aspect as populist icon giver was to celebrate the peace after the atomic bomb dropping in this time.<br />
The vocabulary was almost the same as those of the former two projects, such as strong axis, open space for celebrations, trapezoidal plan emphasizing the monumentality, etc.<br />
Yet in this plan, the roofs are flat roof in stead of &ldquo;Tenchi-Kongen&rdquo; in The Far Eastern and of pitched roof emphasizing the locality in the Bangkok project.",Tokyo,Studio-X Tokyo
Tea Ceremony of the Five Axis Arbor (五軸庵),Friday,9,August,2013,Fabrication Workshop,Studio-X,"In Onahama, a fishermen village and an industrial port, some fifty miles away northern from the Fukushima Daiichi, the Studio-X workshop team, led by Daisuke Hirose, Director got together at the SHIOYA Industry Co., to unleash a newly installed 2 million dollars five axis leaser cutter fresh from the manufacturer, both in its software and machine itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Liberal Democratic Party Abe government, which twice beat Democratic Party definitively at both Lower and Upper House elections,&nbsp; successfully started releasing trillions of yen fund smoothly to the disaster regions, to support not only individual tsunami sufferer&#39;s housing, rebuilding suffered villages or supplying state of art fishing boats to fishermen, but also to wide range of cutting edge high-tech industries including advanced medical technology to　expect rebounding the regional economy and eventually entire Japan&#39;s. The two million dollars five axis cutter of Shioya Industry is expected to supply Fukushima Daiichi and related facilities the ever most efficient way of cutting and connecting different size and shape of steel tubes with exotic angles each other. It&#39;s also assumed to provide powerful/ economical means to carve out propel blades fore series of electric generator wind mills, which plan to be floated on the sea 30 miles away from Fukushima Daiichi. GSAPP Studio-X Tokyo under Daisuke Hirose is planning to promote this green alternative project associating with Power of Art.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The object of the workshop was to fabricate a traditional tea house from steel and&nbsp; carry out an authentic traditional tea ceremony in or on it. The contrast and contradiction between cutting edge technology and tradition was the theme. But that wasn&#39;t easy way to go. The team struggled to overcome endless glitches of computer script and machine&#39;s nature. The machine was a virgin and hold lots of secret behind her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After five days and nights, all the joints were curved out and installed to make a tea house named Five Axis Arbor. At nine o&#39;clock in the morning on fifth day, the authentic tea ceremony was taken place by Master Teru, under a flying steel structure, on a torturing stern steel Tatami, as an ultimate expression of Zen extreme way.",Tokyo,Studio-X Tokyo

The joint international workshop was challenged with considering the role of public space for New Gonghua City, Beijing. Although many scales of public space have been considered in the master plan phase of this new development, the workshop focused on the public landscape that forms a historical tracing of a Ming Dynasty wall. This historical wall once enclosed a palace for the Emperor as a stopover on trips to the tombs. This space is of vital importance to the district.&nbsp;<br />
The energies of the six-week workshop were split across three phases: research, site analysis, and propositions. Working in teams, the students took advantage of their diverse backgrounds, multiple perspectives and unique approaches to generate a multitude of visions and inspirations for the future New Gonghua City. As a starting point, the workshop began by analyzing the proposed master plan submitted by Beijing Technological Business District Development Co. Ltd (TBD). Clear in the planning was the critical role that public space and landscape would play in this new development.&nbsp; Based on the planning and TBD&#39;s ambitions to create an important and vital public space for New Gonghua City, the workshop utilized an experimental method of research and scenario development to produce an array of possible futures for this area.&nbsp;<br />
Resisting the urge to create a unified proposal or master plan, the workshop focused on generating an abundance of ideas that can inspire maximum possibilities.&nbsp; The workshop embraced three strategies, research, redesign, and reframe.&nbsp; Addressing the themes of history and memory, the strategy of reframing generated four potential site conditions: no action, preservation, reconstruction, and new construction/integration.&nbsp; As a catalog of concepts, this diverse collection of ideas can be utilized in the development of the landscape design in the future.&nbsp;<br />
The ideas generated by the workshop offer a multitude of approaches that both reflect the objectives stated above and expand beyond typical and preconceived solutions.&nbsp; Together, these ideas can inspire new experiences and environments that will define the identities and attitudes of New Gonghua City.<br />

MINHA CASA NOSSA CIDADE,Tuesday,30,July,2013,Debate,Studio-X,"As indicated by the title &ldquo;Minha Casa&ndash;&ndash;Nossa Cidade,&rdquo; the central component of the exhibition by MAS Urban Design Zurich in collaboration with Instituto CASA offers a new perspective on the Brazilian law called Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life). Looking at the examples of construction since the 2009 start of the program, whose mission is to provide 3.4 million residential units within five years, the structural questions raised by large-scale and high-cost housing developments have become evident.<br />
<br />
The closing event of the exhibition by MAS Urban Design and Instituto CASA brings together different actors from the fields of housing, the arts and academia to discuss the future of residential development in Brazil. By substituting &ldquo;Our City&rdquo; (Nossa Cidade) for &ldquo;My Life&rdquo; (Minha Vida), the emphasis of these proposals is placed on the production of the city as a collective project, inclusive and sustainable, to the detriment of the privatization of the city by individuals. How can we think and plan for the city according to cost-effective economic models? How can we innovate on the practice of low-cost construction in a sustainable, culturally sensitive and economical way? What we truly need to consider, if we assume as a starting point that our cities need to be conceived in terms of long-term planning, is how do we provide high-quality spaces for future generations?",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

<strong>About the 5th Public Space Workshop: Public Bit</strong><br />
<br />
The Public Space Workshop is an annual architecture design and research workshop run by GSAPP, developed as a collaborative model for trans-disciplinary research and development. Public space is the interface for exchanges in cities, and today more than ever, the site of rapid change. PublicBit is a mobile, open hardware unit developed for deployment in public spaces with sensing capabilities networked for realtime transmission of site specific city data. The data is synthesized to develop spatial proposals for connecting physical and virtual public spaces, both within and between cities. An online platform simultaneously aggregates and broadcasts the data, providing a global platform for exchange. PublicBits form an adaptive infrastructure in cities, emerging, networking, and responding in unprecedented ways through citizen engagement. &ldquo;Public Bits&rdquo; are developed as open source hardware, and made available to participants, providing access and expanding the network. PSW is directed by Jennifer Broutin Farah and Kamal Farah (Columbia University&#39;s GSAPP).<br />
<br />
The 5th Public Space Workshop: Public Bit is conducted in partnership with the German Jordanian Univeristy&rsquo;s School of Architecture and the Built Environment.<br />

Review: 15:00-18:00, Exhibition &amp; Reception: 18:30-20:00<br />
Exhibition Dates: July 1-July 7, 2013 (10:00-18:00)<br />
<br />
Please join us for food and drinks at the final review and exhibition of our workshop &ldquo;Critical Copying&rdquo; held at Studio-X Beijing. In this five-day workshop, students of Columbia University and Tsinghua University explore four concepts of copying to conceive of architectural ways to transform the morphology and typology of buildings. By drawing on a canonical building and transposing it into the Beijing context, iterative copying becomes a generative, critical process, rather than a reductive one. The workshop investigates the transformations that take place through this contextual shift.<br />
<br />
At the exhibition opening, students will present their work to professional architects, academics and their fellow students. Please join us for what promises to be an engaging discussion.<br />
<br />
The workshop participants are: Sophie Hochh&auml;usl (History of Architecture), Alejandro Stein (Architecture), Ray Wang (Architecture), Li Wenling, 李文玲 (Landscape Architecture), Bonny Yau (Critical, Curatorial and Conceptual Practices), Zhang Yichi, 张亦驰 (History and Theory of Architecture) and Ying Zhu, 朱滢 (Urban Planning).<br />

Integrating the Informal,Friday,14,June,2013,Exhibition Opening,Exhibitions,"The informal city in urban centres in India is deeply interwoven with the formal city. And yet, in the broad sweeps of urbanisation that periodicallyovertake our urban centres, the mainstream point of view seems to aim for the &lsquo;rehabilitation&rsquo; of informal spaces into the formal city.<br />
We would like to question this assumption. Informal spaces in cities are often some of the most vibrant and resilient, immediately identifiable and&nbsp;eminently human. We hope to make a case for preserving their identity and culture, while at the same time trying to see how these areas can benefit&nbsp;from public interventions to help curb the onslaught of relentless urbanism.<br />

<strong>Startup Bias: The Culture of Money</strong> is a conversation around movement and access to money. We will be discussing what drives attention and ultimately funding in the startup world. Our speakers will share their insights as to the process of funding, industry implications of attracting capital, and the social and cultural cost to capital. Key questions to think about: does the current system work? If so, is it inclusive? If not, why not? The object is to demystify the machinations around money, access, and privilege and to construct ways to more adequately diversify the funding environment.<br />

Through the light in the dark, this exhibitioni will invite you to experience the essential-&quot;wind&quot; and &quot;light&quot;, which leads us in the whole process.&nbsp;<br />
To us, light illuminating architecture, means a building can communicate with people&rsquo;s senses, it can be understood and recognized by people through integrating and inspiring life.&nbsp;These lights that illuminate architecture, not only light up the real world that architects needs to concern, about material, construction, equipment facility, etc. But also guide them to deal with it.&nbsp;In this exhibition, some of the lights display our idea of wind and light passing through the buildings, others reveal our design of material and structure. Behind everything displayed, are our thoughts and tries about people&rsquo;s experience which influence by architecture.<br />
The exhibition commences on June 1 and will end on June 20. Please join us the opening on June 1, 2013. Food and drinks will be provided.<br />

<em>About &quot;A Sketch of Manners&quot;:<br />
<br />
Alfred Roch, member of the Palestinian National League, is a politician with a bohemian panache. In 1942, at the height of WWII, he throws what will turn out to be the last masquerade in Palestine. Inspired by an archival photograph, &quot;A Sketch of Manners&quot; recreates an unconventional bon vivant aspect of Palestinian urban life before 1948.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Co-scripted with cultural critic Norman M. Klein, &quot;A Sketch of Manners&quot; is the first fragment of a work in progress, &quot;Imagined Cities&quot;, which explores the imaginary of Jerusalem and Los Angeles as promised lands, signifiers beyond the real of the ordinary or real city.

Reception: 5:30-8pm",New York,Avery Library
Instant Installation,Monday,20,May,2013,Exhibition,[object Object],"<span style=""font-size:11px;"">Realized by twenty GSAPP students under the guidance of Caterina Tiazzoldi, director of the Non Linear Solutions Unit (NSU), Instant installation is an adaptive environment in which geometrical configuration and material layering are designed to encourage and to solicit people&#39;s curiosity and reaction. It is a spatial generator, a playful environment inviting all kinds of people to move around in an exhilarating adjustable space that continuously reveals and hidesthe presence of its inhabitants.<br />
&nbsp;</span><br />
The project explores a technique developed in the NSU at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation at Columbia University. Instant Installation challenges the limit between an extremely rationalized design process and the unpredictability of people&#39;s responses, exploring the concept of &ldquo;performative modulation&rdquo; to achieve an innovative, adaptive, prefabricated system. The concept connects a unique spatial experience with a highly innovative and cost-efficient assembly type.<br />
<br />
Instant Installation will be realized with latex tubing and wooden rails that permit the articulation of the space. These rails are products directly importable from an adaptive parametric 3D model. This technique allows for a very precise geometrical set; in this way it is possible to achieve easily installed complex geometries. The rails system can be quickly plugged into the space. The whole structure can be assembled and disassembled easily and quickly.<br />

"Between Past and Future: Technology, Tradition, Innovation",Saturday,11,May,2013,Panel,Studio-X,"<h3>
	<span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Tour and Panel Discussion</span></h3>
<p>With the rapid growth of cities across the Arabian Gulf, the development of small traditional towns into metropolitan centres took priority over the preservation of existing cultural heritage. The fast-paced transformation left little time for a critical theoretical reflection on the process and effects of the ongoing quest for modernity and its various forms of manifestation. In this context, questions of tradition and site-specificity in technological innovation and in the globalisation of cities in the Gulf are essential. This seminar brings together scholars, practitioners, and institutional leaders to raise fundamental questions about the place of cultural identity in the built environment and its relationship with modernity and technology, challenging the commonly perceived opposition between the traditional and the modern.<br />
	The programme consists of a tour of Jazirat Al Hamra, a panel discussion followed by Q &amp; A, and a reception.<br />
	<br />
	Join us for a discussion on <strong>Saturday, May 11, 2013</strong> at Jazirat Al Hamra, Ras Al Khaimah. This coastal village is the last traditional town still standing in the United Arab Emirates and is considered today to be an archeological jewel.<br />

<br />
A Land is where the soil has started to breathe again<br />
A village that does not exist on the map<br />
A people who celebrate life<br />
A no-where, nowhere land...<br />
<br />
When a small farming community in South India decided to switch from their decade old practice of chemical agriculture to organic farming, little did they know that they were planting the seeds of a silent revolution. By showcasing the exemplary efforts of farmers of a tiny village in Andhra Pradesh, Timabktu explores critical issues of food security and sovereignty. At it&rsquo;s heart Timbaktu looks at the relationship that the farmer shares with her land, her seeds and raises critical questions about food, the very essence of human life.<br />

project by Camille Laccad&eacute;e, Francois Roche, Ezio Blasetti, Stephan Henrich, Danielle Willems<br />
<br />
Please join Architects Francois Roche &amp; Camille Lacadee at Studio X Mumbai as they manipulate the floating idea in the pursuit of this ambiguous title &ldquo;the philosopher, the believers and the z&rsquo;shell-ter&rdquo; : what could be the relationship between these antagonist forces, from a strategy of speculation re-questioning the order of discourse, to theology and religious rhetoric, where emerges a figure... from their encounter&hellip; from the contradictory zones of the believers and unbelievers.<br />
This interstice, this crack between two dimensions, two interpretations of the world&#39;s logic (if there is one...), seems to be a territory with its own systemic values, transactional and transitory, as a fragile monkey-bridge joining the antagonist verticalities and their opposites in a shaping relation between power and knowledge.<br />

We will also be joined by Artist Anupam Singh giving his views on the works and his own experience of working within the indian context and Brahimchari Saket Chaitanya who will recite verses from the Bhagavad Gita &amp; Mahabharata which had inspired the creating of the work (in Sanskrit &amp; English)",Mumbai,Studio-X Mumbai

Organized by the <strong>Program in Advanced Architectural Research</strong><br />
<br />
This event will be the first in a series of symposia investigating the role of applied research in architecture. Nestled in an intersection between practice and theory, applied architectural research can potentially work as a space for overlap and negotiation. This event will formally make explicit the opportunities for architectural research to bridge the gap between the archive and the laboratory. Taking advantage of the diversity in the research being tackled by the students of the AAR, a series of specific experts related to each topic will be invited to present and discuss their work. This annual event will continue to critically engage the question: What is applied research in architecture?<br />
<br />
<strong>Format</strong><br />
The event will be organized as a series of conversations&mdash;five distinctive panels&mdash;discussing the limits of applied research in contemporary practices and academia. After a brief presentation, each guest will engage in dialogue with a faculty member to develop further insights into their specific zones of research: architectural pedagogy, new forms of urbanity, historic reconstruction and the political context of the humanities. The final panel will map the various conflicts of interests between the four guests in a roundtable discussion&mdash;moderated by the director of the Advanced Architectural Research program.<br />

<strong>Creative Bankruptcy</strong> is a discussion of the economics around the so-called &quot;creative class.&quot; Innovators say that creativity is the future but what happens if no one wants to pay? Even as we embrace and celebrate the work of artists, writers, and creatives we are challenged by financial paradigms that often struggle to include these players. How are those who drive creativity being compensated? What are the new elements coming into play to value their contribution? How do we reconcile shrinking budgets and tighter financial controls with the desire to produce lasting and innovative work? Join our conversation as we address these issues and more.

<strong>INTENTION</strong><br />
<br />
This symposium examines the intermediation of architecture and fiction. Architecture acts and re-enacts a continuous telling of stories. Fiction is used to establish contexts, outline narratives, describe logics, or frame polemics. Likewise, fiction can be instrumentalized to distort or deceive. Structures both built and unbuilt inflect and are informed by numerous other media such as literature, cinema, theatre, and so on. Despite its ubiquity, the fictive trope&rsquo;s function remains elusive. Utopias and dystopias, visionary drawings and experimental writings, exhibitions and installations, all require, utilize, or play off fiction in order to carve out a space to exist. What are the specificities and eccentricities of fiction&#39;s role in critical, curatorial, and conceptual practices of architecture?<br />
<br />
Fiction allows us to imagine new possibilities, new politics, new modes for living, new ways of understanding the world. Indeed, fiction enables and encourages the elaboration or extrapolation of the present and proves history and memory are mutable and contingent. What para-fictional possibilities open up when architectural production purposely blurs truth and how might this problematize relationships to the real? What are the limits of fiction and its gestures of autonomy? Considering Felicity D. Scott&rsquo;s remarks, &ldquo;Fiction is not just escape from reality but can produce an engaged withdrawal,&rdquo; is it possible to identify not only the mechanics but strategic moments of fiction? How does a fictive architecture prescribe experience or project models, and how do (counter-)narrative forms act as testing grounds for speculative ideas? The seminars&rsquo; conversations will range from the technical to the nonsensical and hopefully help us begin to recognize the myths architecture continues to reproduce and understand the alchemical potential of fiction in the discipline.<br />
<br />
This third annual Interpretations symposium and its live proceedings will form the basis of a forthcoming publication titled ARCHIGONICS. The suffix -gonic implies &ldquo;the work required to facilitate a reaction.&rdquo; In conjunction with documentation of the event, the publication will include additional commissions in the form of contributions and commentary by artists, architects, and curators. It will also include selected writings related to the topic through an open call for papers following the event.<br />

MARK PAULY: GEOMETRIC OPTIMIZATION FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN,Wednesday,17,April,2013,Lunchtime Lecture,Post Parametric,"In this talk, <strong>Mark Pauly</strong> will look at the question of how computation can facilitate, simplify, or enrich architectural design and construction. Geometric constraints derived from material properties, fabrication imperatives, or assembly restrictions typically define complex design spaces. Exploring such spaces to find a design solution that meets all constraints is becoming increasingly difficult as projects grow in size and complexity. Computational solutions can help tame this complexity and allow the architect to focus on the essentials of the design task without worrying about low-level constraint satisfaction. Pauly will show how new geometric optimization methods can be integrated into the architectural design process to facilitate applications in constrained exploration of tessellated freeform surfaces, design of interlocking planar assemblies, and form finding for controlled light patterns.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mark Pauly</strong> is an associate professor at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL, Switzerland. Prior to joining EPFL, he was assistant professor at the CS department of ETH Zurich and a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. He completed his Ph.D. degree in 2003 at ETH Zurich. His research interests include computer graphics and animation, shape processing and analysis, architectural geometry, and geometric optimization and design. Mark is in the steering committee of the Symposium on Advances in Architectural Geometry (AGG) that he co-chaired in 2010.

	The exhibition <em>Tony Oursler, UFOs, and Effigies</em> presents two sets of images drawn from Tony Oursler&rsquo;s extensive photographic archives. The two collections serve not only to open new perspectives onto the more well-known aspects of Oursler&rsquo;s artistic production, but also to raise a larger set of questions about the &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; of the photographic image. Among other important distinctions, the two sets of photographs exhibit different mediatic temperatures. The heightened realism of the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; effigy photos and the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; objectivity of the UFO photography occupy competing and symmetrically opposite evidentiary positions. Each set strains against the outer edges of the truth claims that were culturally invested in photography, particularly as it functioned prior to the widespread adoption of digital photography and the electronic distribution of imagery via the Internet.<br />

Vincent Feltesse,Tuesday,16,April,2013,Lecture,Urban Design Talk,"In France like elsewhere, globalization in weakening the State has put territories on the frontline. This is especially true for the metropolis, the territory most open, most connected, and plugged in to the real world. Metropolises are the venue where innovation unfolds, and are engines for economic growth. Metropolises focus essential strategic inputs, such as creative economy, institutional headquarters, higher education, R&amp;D, but also social struggles. Metropolis governance is thus a crucial issue. The &ldquo;generalized urban setting,&rdquo; and the undefined delineation between city and countryside, have brought about the obsolescence of traditional political institutions, which are no longer able to respond to the challenges of governing metropolitan territories. New practices and new tools must therefore be reinvented. New paths must be found to an effective urban public action.<br />
<br />
Vincent Feltesse, as a French Congressman and President of the Bordeaux Agglomeration, is one of the leading French politicians to think and innovate around metropolitan issues. He is the founder of &ldquo;Les Metropolitaines,&rdquo; a think-tank that focuses on metropolisation processes. In 2012, he directed the web campaign for French President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande.<br />

Philosophical and Technical Challenges of Conserving Composite Cultural Heritage Artifacts,Thursday,11,April,2013,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"<div id="":8z"">
	<div id="":9w"">
		<div dir=""ltr"">
			Material complexity, scale, function and environmental factors, define and unite all forms of cultural heritage. In turn, these parameters shape conservation strategies including treatment, interpretation and display. In this presentation, conservator Paul Mardikian will discuss how the definition of &ldquo;composite materials&rdquo; can expand or contract depending on a number of factors, and in particular, one&rsquo;s individual perspective on the subject. Prominent examples of composite artifacts will be presented and discussed ranging from complex &ndash; and sometimes oversized &ndash; archaeological artifacts recovered from shipwrecks, to built heritage, archaeological or industrial sites.<br />
			<br />
			<em>About Paul Mardikian</em><br />
			Paul Mardikian is senior conservator for the H.L. Hunley Project at Clemson University in South Carolina USA, a position that he has held since 1999. Prior to joining the Hunley Project, he worked on the conservation of artifacts from the RMS Titanic (1912) and the CSS Alabama (1863). He has graduate degrees in archaeology, art history and conservation from the school of the Louvre and the Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne University respectively, specializing in the conservation of underwater cultural heritage. He has provided conservation for numerous maritime excavations in the Mediterranean, Australia, Canada and the United States. Paul&rsquo;s primary interests are the conservation of large-scale maritime archaeological and industrial artifacts, particularly metals and composite artifacts. He is a professional associate member of the American Institute for Conservation and assistant coordinator for the ICOM-CC Metal Working Group (MWG). More recently, Paul served as program chair and co-editor for the MWG interim meeting, METAL 2010.

	<br />
	As global cities and financial centers, New York City and London have much in common&mdash;not least their transportation history. Both committed early to underground rail transportation as a way to ease mounting surface congestion, supporting private franchises which would later become component parts of a municipally owned and operated transit system. In New York, this transit investment followed demand&mdash;with rail and later subway connections mimicking the growth of the city northward and eastward from its origins in lower Manhattan. In London, transit investment in many cases led demand:&nbsp; early underground lines connecting central rail stations were followed by lines stretching out of the city to reach undeveloped land and create new commuter suburbs.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	The early history of London&rsquo;s tube is instructive, as London is once again looking to transit investment to help shape the future growth of the city. Over the last three decades, numerous ambitious transit projects&mdash;from the Docklands Light Railway to the Jubilee Line Extension and London Overground rehabilitation&mdash;have helped to redefine the neighborhoods and hence the property markets in which they are set. Indeed the tie between the two is so strong that the uplift in value resulting from these rail extensions and improvements is now a key ingredient in their funding.<br />
	<br />
	New York, in contrast, has seen no real geographic expansion of its underground rail system over this period. Capital expenditure has instead been focused on bringing the subway system up to a state of good repair and on providing new capacity to relieve oversubscribed rail corridors, such as the Lexington Avenue line on Manhattan&rsquo;s east side. With the exception of the 7 line extension now under construction, economic development goals have not featured prominently as a factor in the prioritization of transit investments.<br />
	<br />
	For two cities that are considered similar in many ways, the difference in approaches to transit investment is marked. Why has one global city chosen to move forward on so many transit-based economic development initiatives while another has not? What has led to London&rsquo;s success in using rail transit to regenerate huge swathes of the city? How have these projects been financed? What role have public and private actors played over time in their success? How and what might New York learn from London&rsquo;s experience? What changes to existing governance or laws might encourage or allow similar investments to be made in New York?<br />

	This first panel provides a short introduction to the evolution of urban transit in New York and London. Both cities have old transport systems that have been the subject of recent renewal and, in London&rsquo;s case, expansion. The panel discusses how transport infrastructure in these cities has historically shaped the urban form, both at the metropolitan and at the city level, through related real estate development.<br />

	The second panel discusses the link that exists today between transport investment and economic development. It will evaluate the impact of public transport projects on land value, real estate development, and ultimately economic growth in the two cities. Using recent examples ranging from the extension of the DLR to the Olympic site to the London Overground, the panel comments on how the extension or rehabilitation of existing rail lines has created space for growth &ndash; and examines why this form of growth has been almost exclusively limited to London.<br />

	This panel examines the challenges associated with multiple institutional levels involved in the planning and implementation of public transport projects. It will contrast the trajectory of projects like the ARC tunnel and the Second Avenue subway with the outcome of those like the Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee Line&mdash;projects deliberately implemented for economic development purposes. Drawing on these and other examples, the panel will explore ways that the challenges of existing governance structures might be overcome as part of developing new models for investment in transit infrastructure in the future.<br />

What has led to London&rsquo;s success in using rail transit to regenerate huge swathes of the city? How have these projects been financed? What role have public and private actors played over time in their success? How and what might New York learn from London&rsquo;s experience? What changes to existing governance or laws might encourage or allow similar investments to be made in New York?<br />

	This first panel provides a short introduction to the evolution of urban transit in New York and London. Both cities have old transport systems that have been the subject of recent renewal and, in London&rsquo;s case, expansion. The panel discusses how transport infrastructure in these cities has historically shaped the urban form, both at the metropolitan and at the city level, through related real estate development.<br />

	The second panel discusses the link that exists today between transport investment and economic development. It will evaluate the impact of public transport projects on land value, real estate development, and ultimately economic growth in the two cities. Using recent examples ranging from the extension of the DLR to the Olympic site to the London Overground, the panel comments on how the extension or rehabilitation of existing rail lines has created space for growth &ndash; and examines why this form of growth has been almost exclusively limited to London.<br />

	With an introduction by Prof. Jorge Otero-Pailos and a response by Prof. Stephen Murray<br />
	<br />
	<em>Lecture Synopsis</em><br />
	Between archaic gothic times and classical style, Notre Dame de Paris was, in the early 13th century, the most accomplished cathedral in Europe. &nbsp;Seven centuries later, Viollet le Duc&rsquo;s work on the building made it the most emblematic example of 19th century restoration, setting the foundation for a new modern way to preserve historical monuments. &nbsp;The Cathedral is a double icon and a masterpiece of both the 13th and 19th centuries, and Benjamin Mouton&rsquo;s contemporary interventions challenge us to once again rethink the discipline for the 21st century.<br />

	In 2011, more than 386 new museums were built in China&mdash;more than one new space for every day of the year&mdash;in an effort to bring the country&#39;s museum-to-citizen ratio up to international levels. Dedicated to art, history, city planning, and more, these often-iconic structures are meant to anchor newly planned civic centers, Central Business Districts, cultural districts, and commercial developments. Some are very successful. Yet others, without clear curatorial missions, long-term plans, or cohesive collections, sit empty. What are the social and spatial implications of the pressure to museumify? This conversation organized by the China Megacities Lab explores different futures for the museum in China.<br />

Protecting Local Livelihoods in Urban Sustainable Development: The Case of Jardim Gramacho,Thursday,28,March,2013,Workshop,Studio-X,"Studio-X Rio Workshop with Instituto de Estudos do Trabalho e Sociedade (IETS)<br />
Organized by May Yu, Columbia University GSAPP<br />
<br />
ABOUT<br />
<br />
How can planners and policymakers best integrate global environmental interests with inclusive local development? In preparation for the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development, the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro and Duque de Caxias ordered the closure of Jardim Gramacho, the largest landfill in Latin America. Gramacho served not only as the disposal site for 80% of Rio&rsquo;s municipal solid waste, it also provided livelihoods for approximately 2,000 catadores (wastepickers) and an informal economy of up to 3,000 workers. While the closure and rehabilitation of Gramacho has been recognized as an environmental triumph, there has been little impact on job creation and training and the integration of catadores into the formal recycling system.<br />
<br />
By focusing on the intersection of employment and environmental sustainability, this workshop will explore the themes of local livelihoods, informal urban economy, and participatory urbanism to develop strategies for building a more equitable and sustainable Gramacho. Discussions and idea-testing will include members from the diverse Gramacho stakeholders, including catadores, community residents, NGOs, scholars, municipal and regional policymakers, among others. Through open, collaborative discussions with stakeholder groups, this workshop will examine the opportunities and challenges of creating a more inclusive Gramacho that benefits the local community of informal workers as well as the Rio metro area.<br />

Read: Revisiting Labrouste in the Digital Age ,Thursday,28,March,2013,Core Series,Core Series,"Held in conjunction with the exhibition <em>Henri Labrouste: Structure Brought to Light</em>, this symposium acts, in part, as the fourth section of the three-part exhibition. It explores how a 19th-century architect and his work, and particularly his innovative use of materials and light in spaces of contemplation and public assembly, are relevant in contemporary culture and architecture. Young and mid-career architects and scholars examine Labrouste&rsquo;s inclusion in a 1975 exhibition at MoMA and how today&rsquo;s context is different; and how issues such as the library in the information age and the collective expression of individual experience, and the rational ornament apply to contemporary practice.<br />

In <a href=""http://bombsite.com/issues/98/articles/2861""><em>BOMB</em></a>, TAX Principal <strong>Alberto Kalach </strong>notes that the design, which combines cantilevered levels of shelves with a long gallery, allows visitors to &ldquo;see all the books, all the knowledge simultaneously,&quot; and to draw connections to the local life of the capital. Built on a once-barren strip of land, the library is wrapped by a botanical garden, where &quot;[t]he classification of plants and the classification of books [can] be congruent.&rdquo; Kalach presents this library within the legacy of Henri Labrouste in a Keynote Address for the two-day GSAPP/MoMA symposium <em><a href=""http://events.gsapp.org/event/revising-labrouste-in-the-digital-age-symposium"">Read: Revisiting Labrouste in the Digital Ag</a></em><a href=""http://events.gsapp.org/event/revising-labrouste-in-the-digital-age-symposium"">e</a>.<br />

Rather than demolish the tower, how could it be reinvented, without extending its footprint or displacing residents for long periods of time? In what Michael Kimmelman in the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/arts/design/renovated-tour-bois-le-pretre-brightens-paris-skyline.html?pagewanted=all""><em>New York Times</em></a> called a &ldquo;case study in architectural ingenuity and civic rejuvenation,&rdquo; the winning design by Anne Lacaton and Jean Philippe Vassal, associated with Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Druot, erected prefabricated modules around the exterior of the building, enchanting units with winter gardens and balconies that provide newfound light and room to move. &ldquo;[O]ur priority,&rdquo; stated Lacaton in the same article, &ldquo;was improving the living conditions for everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:14px;"">Saturday, March 23, 4-6 pm,<br />
Exhibition Dates: 03/23-04/12</span><br />
<br />
As the third X-Agenda Micro-Exhibition, In-Situ/TAO is an exhibition of projects by TAO(Trace Architecture Office) in recent 4 years, including built, un-built, and ongoing projects.<br />
&quot;In-Situ&quot; reflects a consistent viewpoint in TAO&rsquo;s practice: architecture is an integral part of its local environment, rather than an isolated object; In archeology, in-situ means artifact has not been moved from its original place and thus is critical to interpretation of its cultural background and related meaning. Same as architecture, if conceived away from its specific context, it will become only empty symbols, losing its essence. Thus &quot;In-Situ&quot; also means inseparable relationship between the lightness of form and gravity of construction. The reality of here and now needs to be respected.<br />
&quot;In-Situ&quot; also means that architecture is not just an abstract and utopia concept; it is a place for both body and spiritual experience. Therefore each project is concrete and unique. TAO is interested in specific creation of sense of place for each project, and interpreting the complex meanings in both formal and tectonic aspects of architecture. The heterogeneous forms and construction strategies of different projects in this exhibition are the direct embodiment of idea of &quot;In-Situ&quot;.<br />
The exhibition commences on March 23 and will end on April 12.<br />
Please join us the opening on Mar.23, 2013. Food and drinks will be provided.<br />

<span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>X-Agenda 系列微展：在地/迹&middot;建筑</strong></span><br />
作为X-Agenda微展系列的第三站，&ldquo;在地/迹.建筑&rdquo;展出了迹.建筑事务所(TAO)近四年中一些具有代表性的设计项目，包含了建成、未建成、和进行中的项目。<br />
&ldquo;在地&rdquo;反映了迹.建筑的实践中一直持续的观点：建筑与其所在环境是一个有千丝万缕联系的整体，而非孤立的存在。正如考古学中文物必须在原始的环境中去考察方能理解其原初的文化背景及相关意义，建筑如果脱离了具体的环境土壤来审视，也必然成为空洞的符号，丧失其鲜活的特征和现实的意义。因此，&ldquo;在地&rdquo;也意味着形式之轻与建造之重不可割裂的关系。此时此地的现实因素需要被尊重。<br />
&ldquo;在地&rdquo;的另一重含义是：建筑并不只是一种抽象整体的概念，而是带给人身体和精神体验的场所，因此每个个案都是具体而不同的。我们感兴趣的是每一个项目场所意义的的具体营造，并诠释其营造过程中从形式到建造所涉及的丰富意义。展览中不同项目所呈现的异质化的形式和建造策略也成为了&ldquo;在地&rdquo;这一概念最直接的体现。<br />
展期将从3月23日持续至4月12日。欢迎大家参加3月23日的展览开幕式酒会！<br />

<br />
According to Silviano Santiago in Latin American Discourse:&nbsp; The Space In-Between, &ldquo;The major contribution of Latin America to Western culture is to be found in its systematic destruction of the concepts of unity and purity; these two concepts lose the precise contours of their meaning, they lose their crushing weight, their sign of cultural superiority, and do so to such an extent that the contaminating labor of Latin Americans affirms itself as it becomes more and more effective.&nbsp; Latin America establishes its place on the map of Western civilization by actively and destructively diverting the European norm and resignifiying preestablished and immutable elements that were exported to the New World by the Europeans.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The resignification establishes new ambiguous and liminal relationships that in fact become mutable, multi-contingent, and always in a state of in-betweeness.&nbsp; These states of in-betweeness are the heterogeneous context of sets of relations between culture and space in present day Brazil and Rio de Janeiro&hellip; cultural conditions which are neither dominant nor marginal, neither center nor periphery, neither capitalistic nor slavocratic.<br />
<br />
What are the effects of digital technology upon these states of in-betweeness in Rio de Janeiro and upon Brazil&rsquo;s emergence as a global economic power?<br />
<br />
In Brazil the growing debate over the past eight years on the use of new technologies for enhancing public policies led to the formation of the Brazilian Digital Cultural Forum launched by the Ministry of Culture in partnership with the National Network of Education and Research. According to musician / artist Gilberto Gil, head of the 1960&rsquo;s Tropicalia counterculture movement and Minister of Culture under President Lula da Silva , &ldquo;The issue here is that the use of digital technology changes behaviors. The common use of the Internet and free software creates fantastic possibilities for democratizing access to information and knowledge to maximize the potential of products and services, to expand the values that form our common texts, and there-fore, our culture, and also to enhance cultural production, creating new forms of art.&rdquo; Yet, Evgeny Morozov warns against what he calls the &ldquo;net illusions&rdquo;, by which he refers to the emancipatory promises presented by the Internet, without a critical regard.&nbsp; For even though Brazil the fifth largest country worldwide in terms of cell phone absolute numbers, with a 104 percent cell phone penetration rate (Teleco, 2011), there remains significant wealth disparities with&nbsp; both high-income and low-income residents living in very close proximity, the richest 10% of Brazilians receiving 42.7% of the nation&#39;s income, while the poorest 10% receive less than 1.2%, and&nbsp; the myth of racial democracy.<br />

RIO METROPOLITANO,Thursday,14,March,2013,Book Launch,Studio-X,"How to convey the intelligence of the spatial structure beyond its unresolved appearance? Will we be the forever hostages of a purely visual consumption of photogenic design references that are unfit and inert to the frantic everyday of our cities? The analysis presented in this guide-book dedicated to Rio de Janeiro aims to transcend the superficial and external appearance to which we usually limit our perception and understanding of the architectures around us, in order to show how they actually &#39;behave&#39; in our city.<br />
<br />
With the title &#39;Metropolitan Rio: guide for an architecture&#39;, not only do we claim such a condition for our city, but we also advocate an attitude of design that is aware of the urgent need to recognize, understand, value and produce architecture as something capable of taking advantage of this condition in order to increase its potential. This guide differs therefore from the simple collection of references we would consider exemplary of such a performance. Its ambition is to constitute a sort of manual to interact with the built reality in which we are utterly inserted, enabling us to effectively design it.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

Lost Highway,Tuesday,12,March,2013,Photographic,Exhibitions,"There is only one night, there is only one city, there is only one road.<br />
<br />
Along the Highway, the night is passing by. Insomniac and fragile. Made invisible by the metal&nbsp;shell and the speed of my vehicle, I invite myself where I have not been invited.<br />
Protected by the discretion of the night, I surprised in a flash moment these people inside their&nbsp;home. I dine at their table, I watch their TV, I sleep in their bed. Suddenly, their intimacy so rare and&nbsp;precious is simply offered to me. As a silent invitation, I am with the Other.<br />
I watch my intimate Anonymous. They are much more than the story that contains them. They are&nbsp;these millions of solitudes which forms the heart of the cities.<br />
In Tokyo or Cairo, in Sao Paulo or Hong Kong, Bombay or Calcutta, I begin a dialogue, in the heart&nbsp;of the night. As in a ring, I get up on this Highway, to seize these samples of life.<br />
These photographs, in black and white, taken on the fly, from the flyover which crosses the city.Against the lazy night, in suspense, a multitude of lighted windows, like so many promises. They&nbsp;reveal micro worlds: simple or overloaded, overflowing or solitary, this &ldquo;je ne sais quoi&rdquo; I am&nbsp;looking for along the highways.<br />
Lost Highway tells this part common to all great cities, where borders no longer exists. Families are&nbsp;of the same love, loneliness of the same muted violence, wait of the same slowness: all same sighs&nbsp;of a universal language.<br />

THINKING RIO,Tuesday,12,March,2013,[object Object],Studio-X,"The exhibition Thinking Rio brings together fragments of the work of students at Columbia University who had the city of Rio de Janeiro as their focus of investigation.&nbsp; In total, four studios are represented here, from the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) as well as Barnard and Columbia College.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Port, under a process of urban re-birth, was the site of a study on the opportunities and challenges for inclusive housing (Urban Planning Studio, GSAPP, professor Clara Iraz&aacute;bal) and of proposals for large scale multi programmatic buildings in the area (Advanced Architecture Studio VI, GSAPP, professors Juan Herreros and Urtzi Grau).&nbsp; At the heart of downtown Rio, alternatives for a new paradigm of a &#39;super&#39; hospital were tested under different urban conditions (Advanced Architecture Studio VI, GSAPP, professors Eric Bunge and Mimi Hoang).&nbsp; Tiradentes Square and its surrounding fabric (Architectural Design III, Barnard e Columbia College, professor Karen Fairbanks)&nbsp; was the site chosen for proposals addressing the ways in which the complexity of natural resources in the city can be made evident though architecture.&nbsp; Lastly, a group from Urban Design elaborated proposals for the lively Madureira neighborhood in the North Zone of Rio, within a comparative case study also addressing the neighborhood surrounding Itaquer&atilde;o Stadium, under construction for the World Cup in S&atilde;o Paulo and the city of Kumasi, Ghana (Urban Design Studio, director Richard Plunz and professors).",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
LISTENING THERE: SCENES FROM GHANA,Tuesday,12,March,2013,Exhibition Opening,Studio-X,"Two years ago we traveled through Ghana to document the architecture that had been erected over a thirty-year period, beginning in the late 1940s, when colonial rule was ending. These mid-century buildings were mostly modernist, designed by architects from Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Lebanon, Italy and Ghana; they had been reviewed in contemporary architectural publications, as part of a lively debate on what became known as &ldquo;tropical modernism.&rdquo; Until recently, their legacy had all but disappeared from the historical canon; and with their absence we have failed to understand how critical the African continent was to the discourse of modernism. Our trip was motivated by a desire to see how these buildings had fared in the half century since their construction, and to consider how they function in today&rsquo;s increasingly urban and global contexts.<br />
<br />
As agents of the British colonial regime and then as builders for the new Ghanaian state, the architects of these modernist schools, campuses, private homes and government offices believed that new techniques &mdash; advanced construction methods, innovative forms, and ongoing research into climate-responsive design &mdash; could solve the problems of living in &ldquo;tropical regions.&rdquo; Universalism may have been a central tenet of modernism; but its tropical variant diverged from this principle &mdash; it responded to particular local conditions. The local climate drove site strategies that harnessed shade and breezes. Screen walls and brise-soleils, along with rooftop verandahs and deep overhangs, some adapted from local building types, were incorporated to alleviate the heat and correspond to local aesthetics.<br />
<br />
Today, Ghana&rsquo;s modernist architectural icons now sit within fields of hermetically sealed air-conditioned towers skinned in reflective glass. And while tropical modernism may have promised a better world, the rich and poor have continued to occupy separate worlds &mdash; worlds nonetheless interdependent. In between the commercial and governmental districts, like an unstoppable flow, seep the metal roofs of slums housing the millions who&rsquo;ve journeyed from country to city seeking work. At every corner, cities are peppered with cellular communication networks and with brightly colored kiosks vending phone cards. Meanwhile on the coastal edges, unmistakable in their scale, historical slave forts are now destinations for tourist groups, particularly African-American groups, returning to reconnect to their &ldquo;African roots.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The contributions of the Tropical Modern School, while in some respects na&iuml;ve to the harsh realities of nation building, are worthy of reconsideration for both their formal and social engagement. The question of how architecture and architects negotiate the turbulence caused by constant shifts in the balance of power around the world is an open one. To be sure, as we move around the globe we will come across many things that will not be translatable or easily comprehendible. In listening there, we recognize both the promises and challenges of navigating across cultural difference and the need to cultivate new ways to look and to listen.<br />

"MINIATURE, Bruna Canepa & Ciro Miguel",Tuesday,5,March,2013,Exhibition Opening,Studio-X,"Opening March 5th, tuesday,&nbsp; at 6:30pm<br />

<br />
A prisoner paints a landscape on the wall of his cell showing a miniature train entering a tunnel. When his jailers come to get him, he asks them &ldquo;politely to wait a moment, to allow me to verify something in the little train in my picture. As usual, they started to laugh, because they considered me to be weak-minded. I made myself very tiny, entered into my picture and climbed into the little train, which started moving, then disap-peared into the darkness of the tunnel. For a few seconds longer, a bit of flaky smoke could be seen coming out of the darkness of the round hole. Then this smoke blew away, and with it the picture, and with the picture, my person...&rdquo; How many times poet-painters, in their prisons, have broken throu-gh walls, by way of a tunnel! How many times, as they pain-ted their dreams, they have escaped through a crack in the wall! ...If need be, mere absurdity can be a source of freedom.<br />
Gaston Bachelard, &ldquo;The miniature&rdquo; in Poetics of Space<br />
<br />
Is it the city that is out of scale, deformed, and temporally displaced, or the site, the building, both? The operations and strategies put forward by Miniatura come from the clash between the incongruence of the material landscape and architectural cul-ture of the metropolis&mdash;which in S&atilde;o Paulo has reached the status of aberration&mdash;and the prominence of the exorbitant American natural landscape conditioning ur-ban scenarios like Rio de Janeiro and Santiago. Architects could only wish they had imagined the different scales, forms, geologic formations, and temporalities that co-exist in such setups.<br />
If the incongruence of their built environment is formally, temporally and spatially decontextualized in Miniatura&rsquo;s drawings, collages and models, the question of form, scale and time is again complicated when these buildings are reinserted in the diffe-rent landscapes of its photographs. By isolating and re-contextualizing, Miniatura transfers and tests proceedings to the extreme: superimposing, narrowing, encrus-ting, sectioning, stratifying, turning, displacing, illuminating, walling, flooding. Howe-ver, the images presented do not always consist of photomontages.<br />
But what is real? What has been imagined?<br />
Like in All Fires the Fire, in which every &ldquo;figure&rdquo; proposed by the Argentinian writer Julio Cortaz&aacute;r relates to each other in different spaces and temporalities &ndash; Cuba, Paris, Buenos Aires, a Greek island, Ancient Rome, Beirut &ndash; from which they can exit and enter, Miniatura searches analogous relations not in fiction but in the incon-gruous reality, reminding us that the latter often surpasses the architect&rsquo;s imaginati-on. No need to paint the dream and escape through a crack in the wall, as in the miniaturized world evoked by Bachelard: the sheer absurdity of the streets is still the largest source of freedom for the voluntary prisoners of architecture.<br />

Detroit Future City:  The Remaking of an American City,Tuesday,26,February,2013,LiPS,LiPS,"Cities are always in a process of change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 1950&rsquo;s, change for Detroit has resulted in fewer people living in the city and a larger amount of vacant land left where people and businesses once resided.&nbsp;<strong>But, a smaller population should not mean a lower quality of life for the residents and businesses of Detroit.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The current image and culture of Detroit is the result of several decades of physical and social change. Today, neighborhoods once settled by African American plantation workers from the south now resemble those same rural landscapes, and the places where things were made and used all over the world now stand as overgrown shells of the city&rsquo;s industrial legacy. A community that once mobilized collective action efforts for broad social equity reform, now organizes to self-police its neighborhood streets and rid adjacent abandoned properties of unsafe and unhealthy activities, like illegal dumping and loitering.&nbsp;The civic leadership of Detroit recognized that its short-term health and solvency was unavoidably linked to how the city would need to operate as a more efficient and sustainable place to live work and play in the future.&nbsp;<strong>The Detroit Works Project, Long Term Planning initiative (DWPLTP) has been a 24-month planning and civic engagement process resulting in the&nbsp;<em>Detroit Future City Strategic Framework</em>&nbsp;<em>Plan</em>,&nbsp;a comprehensive and action-oriented blueprint for near and long range decision-making.</strong>&nbsp;Its purpose was established to record a shared vision for Detroit&rsquo;s future and provide a blueprint for how through shared responsibility and collective action, multiple sectors could work together and alongside one another to realize the changes needed over time.<br />

	<br />
	This lecture will focus on images of vacated and suspended life in Gaza after the bombardment of 2008&ndash;9 by Swedish photographer and video-maker, <strong>Kent Klich</strong>.&nbsp; These images of ordinary life in Gaza in the aftermath of the bombardment of 2008&ndash;9 document vacated structures and suspended lives. They constitute the visual sequel to war photography, the landscape of architectural ruins of everyday life, uninhabited and uninhabitable. Abandoned and decimated structures still give a sense of vanished ways of life, and those still alive are endlessly waiting for their lives. The temporal and spatial conditions of living on with no life, dying without death, are explored through visual images that document the destruction that outlasts war&mdash;dispossession.<br />

"POSTPONED!!! “the philosopher, the believers & z’shell-ter”",Friday,15,February,2013,Exhibition Opening,Studio-X,"THIS EVENT HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE<br />
ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED IS REGRETTED<br />
&ldquo;the philosopher, the believers &amp; z&rsquo;shell-ter&rdquo;<br />
What could be the relationship between these antagonist forces, from a strategy of speculation re-questioning the order of discourse, to theology and religious rhetoric, where emerges a figure... from their encounter&hellip; from the contradictory zones of the believers and unbelievers?<br />
This interstice, this crack between two dimensions, two interpretations of the world&#39;s logic (if there is one...), seems to be a territory with its own systemic values, transactional and transitory, as a fragile monkey-bridge joining the antagonist verticalities and their opposites in a shaping relation between power and knowledge.<br />
For example, in the Indian culture, we could approach the Bhaghavad Gita through a multitude of interpretation (especially on the fight between the two brothers):&nbsp; from a fairy tale to a religious report, from moralistic speeches to a pitch for Bollywood production, from a sacred scripture to a philosophical and psychological questioning of the notion of identity, duplicity, integrity, consciousness and being.<br />
The round table will be the occasion to open forbidden doors and discourses, on the logic and ill-logic of things, on the relation between reason and madness, on the distribution of knowledge between the new world bourgeoisie tabula-rasa (consuming, acting, speaking, Facebooking &hellip;) and the singularities of a territory (with its ghosts and daemons, its hopes and dark sides&hellip; of the initial cultural bouillon).<br />
In the background, underneath of this interrogation, a more crucial question slowly reveals itself: Can we foresee for India, (as is happening everywhere,) the invasion of the autistic over-designed international architecture, following eastern countries such as China, Thailand, Singapore&hellip; with no other identity than the personification of post-capitalism meanings, values and designs&#39; sprawling&hellip;<br />
Or is India able to create the specificity of its development, by extracting substances from its history, its alive polytheism, its democratic turbulence, its intrinsic relationships between narration and technologies (from sophisticated hand-made to computing fabrication, from the traditional transmission of know-how to programming machines and behaviors).<br />
Could we plan a situationist activism in terms of production, which would combine expertise, recognition of the needs and conflicts, but also lines of subjectivity extracted from the polyphonic listing above&hellip;<br />
The second part of the event is the little show presenting &ldquo;z&rsquo;shell-ter&rdquo;.<br />
It is a story of the owner of a large library in Gokarna, he collected 100 000 books about philosophy, psychology, some on palm leaves... He is a Brahman...but because of this huge rare collection he has been rejected a long time ago from Gokarna village as an agnostic or atheist collector in a very religious Hindu zone....<br />
The collection has been preserved in a new building on the top of the village by alien fund&hellip;which will open soon as an incredible public library (the Study Circle). But at the same time it has aroused the jalousie and hate from village... he commissioned to find a way, to do something or anything in order to recreate the link ...similar to the excerpts Bhaghavad Gita of the Mahabharata, when Krishna helps one brother to engage the war against the other one...as a representation of the conflict of his own self-indulgence&hellip;<br />
In this sense, a small structure able to soak trough interstices between the philosopher and the believers&hellip;. able to trap their symmetrical self-confidence and self-indulgence, has been completed as equal distance from both locations.&nbsp; This illusion-catcher is open to be used by the both side&hellip;<br />
The Brahmans in charge of temple came and validated this singularity, in charge to collect human pathologies, on one side the beliefs and certitudes of the community, and on the other the arrogant loneliness of the philosopher&hellip;<br />
That is a true story and the old man in the movie is the owner of the library... as a report, a &ldquo;mockumentary&rdquo; of the situation.",Mumbai,Studio-X Mumbai

&ldquo;The future of our buildings, our cities, and our lives is inseparable from the future of energy. No issue is more urgent,&rdquo; says Mark Wigley.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While policies around environmental sustainability necessarily extend to sectors beyond AEC industries, the panel will address the building industry within the context of a much broader and interdependent set of systems. For example, the technology of building energy performance with regard to windows, daylighting, lighting systems, and new methods of performance simulation will be considered.<br />
<br />
Additionally, &ldquo;Power: On the Future of Energy&rdquo; will address the balance between government energy regulations and market-driven development. For instance, how can the abundance of inexpensive natural gas made available through fracking negatively impact the development of renewable resources such as wind and solar energy? What forms of government incentives are needed to continue to grow new markets of alternative energy sources? Will disincentives also need to be increased to break us from forms of energy consumption and carbon emissions that have become integral to our lifestyle but have taken profound environmental tolls across the globe?<br />

Camouflage,Tuesday,12,February,2013,Public Installation,Studio-X,"CAMOUFLAGE<br />
It takes a couple of seconds for the eyes to settle down and distinguish background from foreground or vice versa. Once the eyes are at home with the image, you realise that this green-on-green image is sheltering a fantastic fugitive. The chance positioning of the creature on a thick spread of grass, the documentation that followed and finally the image that was found floating online, each contributed to Valsan&rsquo;s Leaf, Let Into Earth, 2010, becoming the starting point of Camouflage.<br />
<br />
Stone, bronze, coconut palm fronds, steel and twigs are just some of the materials that&rsquo;ve been marked present in Valsan&rsquo;s illustrious roster of materials. Despite being regularly interspersed across his oeuvre the artist&rsquo;s ephemeral artworks, with their special focus on sustainability, continue to dwell under the radar, where they&rsquo;ve been held hostage by a market system that values, pun intended, the seemingly inexhaustible physicality of works made from hardier stuff such as bronze. The easily weathered works have been consistently seen as downtime extracurriculars performed in either the public or the artist&rsquo;s private domain and then swept away.<br />
<br />
The Mumbai Port Trust Garden was the immediate site of choice for this project because it resonates with, among other things, the thematic of camouflage. Despite being a rare green patch, the public garden has, thus far, used the nondescriptness of its facade to camouflage itself against the city where it positions itself as a public secret.<br />
<br />
The project comprises a sequence of site-specific interventions and ephemeral works made from a combination of found and procured matter taken from nature and scattered across the premises of the garden. In both these instances, concealment is sought. Camouflage can be critical when it comes to tackling the bigness of urbanity; it allows one the possibility of stillness and the energy to be exhausted.<br />
<br />
Outside of the theme of camouflage there&rsquo;s the logic of the medium and Valsan is alway interested in extending this by pushing for the ontology of the material as best he can. Translating encrypted experiences of easily-weathered matter he focuses on perishability, recycling and sustainable practices.<br />

"Planning, Privatization, and Public Works: Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and the People’s “Silver Lining”",Tuesday,12,February,2013,LiPS,LiPS,"In New Orleans, more than seven years after Hurricane Katrina, public services have been systematically dismantled and privatized, union contracts have been summarily abrogated, and 100,000 people, disproportionally black and poor, have not been able to return to the city. A similar corporate-made disaster is underway in post-Sandy New York City, as corporate and state officials use the storm as a pretext to close public schools, hospitals, and housing and spur further gentrification along the city&rsquo;s waterfront. Jay Arena will discuss &nbsp;an alternative, people-centered, rebuilding agenda that New Orleans&rsquo;s public housing and right of return movement demanded in the wake of Katrina&mdash;and one that has even more resonance in the aftermath of Sandy and the post-2008 fully capitalist made economic disaster that is wrecking havoc from Manhattan to Madrid.

<p>Since the Enlightenment, both architecture and the law have provided parallel and often complimentary definitions of the public and private. Under network culture, however, walls have a new permeability and laws have a new instability. Amidst all this, our own perception of what constitutes private life is changing with our use of online social networks.<br />

Klaus Jacob, Ph.D.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jacob is one of the world&#39;s leading climate scientists. Dr. Jacob has worked at Columbia University for over forty years. He started as research associate in geophysics and seismology at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University (1968-73). Since 1973 he has been a Senior Research Scientist at LDEO, a position from which he retired in 2001. Presently, Professor Jacob is a part-time Special Research Scientist at LDEO, combined with Adjunct Professor position at SIPA (2000-present). He has also taught at the Department of Environmental Sciences, Barnard College (1999-2005), and the Graduate School for Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (2001-2003).<br />
<br />
Dr. Jacob&#39;s research career evolved from basic Earth sciences to disaster risk management, regulatory policies and infrastructure/urban development; he bridges the interface of Earth science, engineering and public affairs. His focus is climate change and earthquakes. His basic research in seismology and tectonics stretched over 5 continents. Dr. Jacob cofounded the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research; contributed to the U.S. National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program&#39;s National Seismic Hazard Maps. He coauthored the U.S. national model and the New York City seismic building codes. He worked with the Emergency Management Communities at the federal, state, and local levels on risk mitigation strategies, including the recovery phase of the WTC disaster in NYC. He specializes in multi-hazard risk assessment, quantitative disaster loss estimation, and disaster mitigation research. Recent research include risks from global climate change, sea level rise, coastal storm surges, flooding and inundation, primarily of infrastructure systems in global megacities; and the sustainability of cities vis-&agrave;-vis natural hazards.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jacob has (co-) authored more than 150 scientific and technical publications and book chapters. Sample publications are: &ldquo;Responding to Climate Change in NY State&rdquo;; Chapter 9: Transportation; Chapter 10: Telecommunication (NY Acad. Sc., 2011); &ldquo;Climate Change Adaptation in NYC&rdquo;; Chapter 7: Indicators and Monitoring (NYAS, 2010); &ldquo;Potential Impacts of Climate Change on US Transportation&rdquo; (NRC/NAS, 2008); &ldquo;Vulnerability of the NYC Metropolitan Area to Coastal Hazards, Including Sea-Level Rise: Inferences for Urban Coastal Risk Management and Adaptation Policies&quot; (Elsevier, 2006);&nbsp; &ldquo;Multihazard Risks in Caracas, Venezuela&rdquo;, Chapter 5 in &lsquo;Natural Disaster Hotspots &ndash; Case Studies&rsquo; (World Bank, 2006); and &quot;Futuristic Hazard and Risk Assessment: How do We Learn to Look Ahead (Invited Commentary)&quot; in Natural Hazard Observer (July 2000). Past projects include &quot;Urban Planning of a Disaster-Resilient Mega-City&quot; with regional focus on Caracas, Venezuela (2001); Istanbul, Turkey (2002); and Accra, Ghana (2003); a seismic hazard analysis for the Republic of Singapore. Dr. Jacob has testified before U.S. Congressional Committees. He works with professional organizations and the media. He is a member of the American Geophysical Union, Seismological Society of America, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute and the American Geological Institute. Mayor Bloomberg appointed him to the New York Panel on Climate Change (NPCC); he also served on NY State&rsquo;s Sea Level Rise Task Force.<br />
<br />
Professor Jacob earned a BS in Mathematics and Physics at the Technical University, Darmstadt (1960); a MS in Geophysics (1963) from Gutenberg University, Mainz; and a PhD (1968) from Goethe University, Frankfurt, all in Germany. He was a research associate in geophysics at University of Frankfurt 1964 to 1968; and a visiting scientist at the BP Research Center, Sunbury-on-Thames, U.K. (1963-64).",New York,"100 Level, Avery Hall"

Soazic Guezennec, French artist living in Mumbai, is opening a new kind of real estate, displaying imaginary architectural projects which reinstate untamed nature inside the city.<br />
Noticing the gap between the concept of &quot;Nature City&rdquo; plugged by the real estate adverts and the reality, Soazic Guezennec designs architectural projects which take the real estate slogans at their word, creating a city where nature would reassert itsself, in a poetic and sometimes violent way. It gives birth to exuberant creations where buildings turn into waterfalls, mushrooms invade the town, mountains fall from the sky like landscape prostheses. In order to make this utopia credible, the projects are described on the classic supports of the real estate communication: videos, brochures, plans, models and advertisement posters.<br />
Visitors are invited to express their desires and habitat dreams, and are encouraged to become members of the community of these highly subjective constructions.<br />

His work has been noted by Bruno Latour as &quot;a [b]eautifully simple and terribly efficient&quot; metaphor for a social theory. How has Saraceno&#39;s training as an architect informed his artistic practice? This conversation with Juan Herreros explores disciplinary boundaries in architecture, and their blurring.</p>

<br />
<strong>Rakesh Rootsman Rak </strong>- Experienced Permacultre designer/teacher and Forest Garden specialist, computer consultant, yoga teacher and homeopath. He has been designing and teaching forest gardening for the past 5 years. Rakesh has designed and implemented forest gardens from small-scale private gardens and schools, to farms, community gardens, communal nature gardens, as well as designing a forest garden on part of a 30-hectare ecovillage in Croatia that he co-owns. Rakesh is also passionate about sharing his journey of self empowerment (learning how to make all the things you need for yourself rather than relying on the system to provide for you), this includes eco architecture (low impact housing); capturing and storing energy (electricity, heat, lighting, etc); fuel efficient heating systems (rocket heaters and stoves); water capture, purification and recycling systems, natural bee keeping and so on. So be prepared to go off on inspirational tangents occasionally.",Mumbai,Studio-X Mumbai

<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Concept</strong></span><br />
The outsourcing of production processes involves the formation of complex spatial structures and<br />
territories determined by time zones, language skills, tech talent, costs of labor and taxation. Despite the<br />
virtualization of these networked territories, in the so-called geopolitics of service supply, location is still<br />
relevant, as well as its architecture. However, both terms &ndash;location and architecture&ndash; should be critically<br />
examined and even redefined in relation to the governance of work processes across space.<br />
What are, we might ask, the architectures of outsourcing? Can or should we reverse its conditions<br />
in order to make them operate in a critical mode and even run counter to the capitalist economic system?<br />
From the network to the workplace, architecture serves as a key component of these complex<br />
processes of production and provides the means by which outsourced offices &ldquo;touch-down.&rdquo; Not only<br />
architecture, architects also work under logics of outsourcing.<br />
This conceptual territory will be unfolded through an exhibition, Locating Out-Sourcing, which<br />
draws a parallel between two cities - New York and Mumbai - by analyzing and reimagining how these<br />
cities feed back into each other through their outsourcing practices, the differences among them and their<br />
means of interexchange.<br />
