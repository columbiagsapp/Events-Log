This multimedia exhibition is the outcome of New York-based firm So-Il&rsquo;s (Solid Objectives &ndash; Idenburg Liu) collaborations with artists including <strong>Iwan Baan </strong>and <strong>Paula Hayes</strong>. In their boundary-crossing designs &ndash; here represented in video, photographs, shadow projections and models - Principals <strong>Jing Liu</strong> and GSAPP instructor <strong>Florian Idenburg</strong> offer a new cultural definition of sustainability. Set against the staggering complexity of urban sprawl in China, this vision finds new traction and indicates considered alternatives to the groundless path of development today.<br />

It is structured around a dialogue between <strong>Manuel Mansylla</strong> and <strong>Dennis Maher</strong>, who promote the use of reclaimed, recycled and re-purposed materials in their artistic practices, addressing both the global scale of environmental systems, and that of objects and architectural spaces.<br />
<br />
There will be a question and answer session moderated by <strong>Angela Chen-Mai Soong</strong> and <strong>Sandro Marpillero</strong> (AUD GSAPP Faculty) to foster a conversation between the artists and the audience, which includes both the AUD class as well as outside guests. The theme of waste will also be addressed by a display of AUD2010 students&rsquo; work, which engages post-industrial sites in Bushwick (Brooklyn) with installations documented by short videos. The event will reveal the potential use of waste objects to read, interact, investigate and reconstruct urban conditions.<br />

Black Gold: Film Screening & Discussion,Thursday,18,November,2010,Film Screening,Studio-X,"Multinational coffee companies now rule our shopping malls and supermarkets and dominate the industry worth over $80 billion, making coffee the most valuable trading commodity in the world after oil. But while we continue to pay for our lattes and cappuccinos, the price paid to coffee farmers remains so low that many have been forced to abandon their coffee fields. Nowhere is this paradox more evident than in Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. Tadesse Meskela is one man on a mission to save his 74,000 struggling coffee farmers from bankruptcy. As his farmers strive to harvest some of the highest quality coffee beans on the international market, Tadesse travels the world in an attempt to find buyers willing to pay a fair price.<br />

China today has overtaken Japan as the second largest economy in the world. Urbanization in China is urgent, incessant, and of gargantuan proportions. In the last two decades, cities and urban forms have experienced unprecedented transformation and development. A sense of speed, simultaneity, and complexity accompany the urban transformations. The processes of building and un-building have unleashed the creative power of architecture and city design in multiple ways: as an artistic endeavor exploring spectacular forms; as a global project expanding the boundaries of global flows investments, technical expertise, and labor; as a productive enterprise testing the limits of mass production and markets; as having the power to create simultaneously, concrete jungles and ecologically sustainable cities; and as a symbolic force that constructs national narratives and local identities.<br />
<br />
This two-day symposium will bring together experts, scholars, and critical thinkers of urbanism in China to explore urgent issues facing Chinese cities today, and to discuss the new challenges of development and urbanization they must confront in the coming two decades.<br />

Underdome catalogs a spectrum of positions argued by economists, environmentalists, community advocates, political scientists, and designers. In turn, it highlights in architecture questions of architectural agency, the contemporary city, and collective priorities in the face of ecological and economic uncertainty.

About Underdome:<br />
Underdome is an architect&#39;s guide to contending energy agendas. A cross between an architectural handbook and a voter&#39;s guide, the project maps approaches to the management of energy use to examine their implications for public life. Underdome catalogs a spectrum of positions argued by economists, environmentalists, community advocates, political scientists, and designers. In turn, it highlights in architecture questions of architectural agency, the contemporary city, and collective priorities in the face of ecological and economic uncertainty. The Underdome guide invites designers to use their interpretations of energy as forms of political action-as votes for possible futures. Underdome will launch an online guidebook and a series of panel discussions called &quot;The Underdome Sessions&quot; in October 2010.<br />

Synthetic biology is a new approach to designing biology. It involves a framework of standardized biological parts that can be composed to create new living systems not found in nature. Current and future applications include yeast engineered to produce an inexpensive anti-malaria drug and a seed designed to grow into a building.<br />
<br />
This series of events brings together biologists, artists, sociologists, philosophers, and architects to share current work and discuss future possibilities for design, architecture, innovation, and danger in the century of biology.<br />

Amman: Comfort Exhibition Opening And Reception,Thursday,5,August,2010,[object Object],Studio-X,"Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation&rsquo;s Amman Lab invites you to attend a student exhibition opening and reception. The works being displayed are the final projects from the Amman Lab Workshop 2010: Comfort.<br />
<br />
The Amman Lab Workshop is an intensive three week exploration of emergent issues concerning contemporary public space in the Middle East. With the city of Amman serving as an active testing ground, students and faculty from universities throughout the region collaborate to expand their understanding of design issues through research, experimentation, discussion and feedback.<br />
<br />
The 2010 workshop focused on Comfort. As a precondition of public space, Comfort is necessary to provide an environment in which assembly and exchange may occur. With physical, virtual, sensorial and emotional attributes, Comfort can be expressed through different mediums and at varying scales. It is delicate, elusive, and necessary.<br />
<br />
The students participating are from Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation; American University of Sharjah, College of Architecture, Art and Design; Birzeit University, Department of Architectural Engineering; and Jordan University of Science and Technology, College of Architecture and Design.<br />

Rio de Janeiro is preparing major infrastructural projects that are being coordinated by decision makers at an international level, from where the little details and textures of an urban scene cannot be perceived. Unsolicited architecture operates independently and creatively finds &ldquo;clients, sites, and a budget&rdquo; willing to develop alternative solutions to fill the gaps in the system. This workshop aims to provoke the exchange of ideas between local and foreign architects to identify simple transformations that improve everyday life.<br />

<br />
The mass audience and mass media analyzed by the Frankfurt School are long gone. As digital media and network technologies are increasingly integral with everyday life, the public is transforming. Today we inhabit multiple, overlapping and global networks such as user forums, Facebook, Flickr, blogs, and wikis. In lieu of watching TV, listening to the radio, or playing records, we text each other, upload images to social networking sites, remix videos, write on blogs and make snarky online comments. The media industry, which just a decade ago seemed well established, is in flux, facing its greatest challenge ever. If we can be certain of anything, it&#39;s that as Karl Marx wrote, &lsquo;all that is solid melts into air.&rsquo;<br />
<br />
In 2008, Columbia University&#39;s Network Architecture Lab published &lsquo;Networked Publics,&rsquo; a book produced in collaboration with the University of Southern California&#39;s Annenberg Center for Communication examining how the social and cultural shifts centering around new technologies have transformed our relationships to (and definitions of) place, culture, politics, and infrastructure.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Discussions on Networked Publics&rsquo; seeks to explore the ramifications of these changes, giving particular attention to architecture and cities. In a set of five panels--culture, place, politics, infrastructure, and network society--we will explore the consequences of networked publics in detail. Our goal will be to come to an understanding of the changes in culture and society and how architects, designers, historians, and critics might work through this milieu. Discussions will be recorded for playback on the Internet and eventually edited and transcribed into a pamphlet to be made available at the conclusion of the series.&quot;<br />

<br />
Over the past 20 years, the United States has been experiencing a wave of immigration unparalled since the turn of the last century. However, immigration policy discussions at the national level thus far have given little attention to the local nature of this phenomenon; migrants move to cities and have an impact on the communities in which they live. While immigration policy is the exclusive authority of the federal government, national lawmakers have thus far failed to create a comprehensive legal and policy framework that reflects the reality of the current era of migration to the United States.<br />
<br />
In the absence of clear direction or support from Washington, municipalities around the country are increasingly forced into the role of de facto immigration policy makers--a role beyond the legal authority, enforcement capability and expertise of most municipal governments. The situation presents a huge challenge for urban governance as local authorities across the country struggle to adapt and provide services to a newly arriving immigrant population.<br />
<br />
Drawing New York City&rsquo;s wealth of experience as a traditional immigrant gateway city, this panel will bring together experts from municipal government, advocacy and academic communities to explore the notion of rescaling immigration policy from the national to the local level. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities for local governance in the current federal landscape and learn about how New York City&rsquo;s approach to issues such as housing, public safety and access to public services and the effect on immigrant communities across the city.&quot;<br />

Trans Siberia,Friday,26,March,2010,Exhibition,Studio-X,"TRANS SIBERIA explores how politics inform architecture. By traveling the length of the Trans-Siberian Railroad between January 28 and February 19, 2010, Warm Engine investigated the rise [and fall] of 20th-Century communism in the access-dependent cities that developed in Russian and China alongside the railroad&#39;s 8,061 km stretch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Warm Engine</strong> focused on the administrative centers of fourteen cities, from the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square in Beijing&mdash;one-third of the earth&#39;s latitude away. The dearth of publicly accessible information about these communist-era built &quot;relics&quot; belies Russian and Chinese closed-door policies. These structures have not been erased, nor discarded, with the fall of communism in Russia or the shift to capitalism in China, much like the way that imperial-era buildings were once appropriated by communists. In TRANS SIBERIA, these overlapping changeovers are explored in diagrammatic drawings that reflect the structure of the journey&mdash;exploded architectural axonometric drawings of each city&#39;s political seats of power, and their development from the early 20th Century to today, forming a continuous analysis from one city to the next along the route.<br />

Discussions will be recorded for playback on the Internet and eventually edited and transcribed into a pamphlet to be made available at the conclusion of the series.<br />

Imagination Vessels,Monday,22,March,2010,Exhibition,Studio-X,"Over the course of one intensive week earlier this year, <strong>Sergio Cezar</strong> (artist, Rio de Janeiro) collaborated with Studio Sangue Bom 2010* in an experiment rooted in cultural exchange, poised between art and architecture.&nbsp; Coupling his low-tech approach and philosophy of &ldquo;recycle the city: recycle your view&rdquo;, with the studio participants&rsquo; inherently progressive and diverse approaches to articulate space, Sergio Cezar worked with architecture students from China, Taiwan, Peru, Colombia, Iran, Iceland, Israel, Austria, Spain and USA to create a collection of spatial constructs which were simply fueled by a live exchange of ideas and moves, simultaneously recording and projecting the transmission of imagination through action.&nbsp; Impossible to predict the outcome prior to initial engagement, the resultant vessels are inherently geared to invite wandering contemplation through spatial engagement.<br />
<br />
IMAGINATION VESSELS is an exhibition that weaves this work together with selected material from &ldquo;Feito pro Rio&rdquo; (Made for Rio), a cloud of spatial questions rapidly produced and installed by Studio Sangue Bom 2010 at Museu de Arte Moderna / MAM Rio, along with a new round of architectural explorations launched upon the studio&rsquo;s recent return from Rio.<br />

Foodprint NYC,Saturday,27,February,2010,Panel,Studio-X,"Foodprint NYC is the first in a series of international conversations about food and the city. From a cluster analysis of bodega inventories to the cultural impact of the ice-box, and from food deserts to peak phosphorus, panelists will examine the hidden corsetry that gives shape to urban foodscapes, and collaboratively speculate on how to feed New York in the future. The free afternoon program will include designers, policy-makers, flavor scientists, culinary historians, food retailers, and others, for a wide-ranging discussion of New York&rsquo;s food systems, past and present, as well as opportunities to transform our edible landscape through technology, architecture, legislation, and education.<br />

The Network Architecture Lab announces a series of evening panels entitled &ldquo;Discussions on Networked Publics &ldquo;at Columbia University&#39;s Graduate School of Architecture, Preservation, and Planning&#39;s Studio-X Soho to investigate the changing conditions of the media, architecture, and urbanism today.<br />
<br />
The mass audience and mass media analyzed by the Frankfurt School are long gone. As digital media and network technologies are increasingly integral with everyday life, the public is transforming. Today we inhabit multiple, overlapping and global networks such as user forums, Facebook, Flickr, blogs, and wikis. In lieu of watching TV, listening to the radio, or playing records, we text each other, upload images to social networking sites, remix videos, write on blogs and make snarky online comments. The media industry, which just a decade ago seemed well established, is in flux, facing its greatest challenge ever. If we can be certain of anything, it&rsquo;s that as Karl Marx wrote, &quot;all that is solid melts into air.&quot;<br />
<br />
In 2008, Columbia University&#39;s Network Architecture Lab published Networked Publics, a book produced in collaboration with the University of Southern California&#39;s Annenberg Center for Communication examining how the social and cultural shifts centering around new technologies have transformed our relationships to (and definitions of) place, culture, politics, and infrastructure.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Discussions on Networked Publics&rdquo; seeks to explore the ramifications of these changes, giving particular attention to architecture and cities. In a set of five panels&mdash;culture, place, politics, infrastructure, and network society&mdash;we will explore the consequences of networked publics in detail. Our goal will be to come to an understanding of the changes in culture and society and how architects, designers, historians, and critics might work through this milieu. Discussions will be recorded for playback on the Internet and eventually edited and transcribed into a pamphlet to be made available at the conclusion of the series.<br />

January 2010: the 20teens<br />
New Year&#39;s Day 2010.<br />
The promises and terrors of our previously projected futures have both manifest and been forgotten.&nbsp; We are not living in a world of flying cars, intergalactic civilian travel, hovercraft skateboards, or robot assistants. But we do have real-time video chat, the Hubble telescope, maglev trains and smart phones.<br />
<br />
Images of our present future have historically been either utopian or dystopic. The technologies that were going to save us or destroy us have arguably done both to some degree, creating our greatest problems and our most significant solutions. We have more information at our fingertips than ever before and fewer critical tools to navigate that information with discrimination. We are more connected through our myriad telecommunications and more disconnected due to a growing class divide. The future is more complex than could&#39;ve been predicted: it is more nuanced and diverse than Huxley, Orwell, Le Corbusier, or Nostradamus knew.<br />
<br />
Times of crisis and calamity, like today, always put ideas in high demand: big ideas and big dreams to foster the next wave in invention and innovation on our way toward tomorrow. We are now living in what has historically been the future. Now that we are here, what is next? What is our future? This an open call for visionaries.<br />
<br />
Answers to this question can take many forms: renderings of future imagined cities, advertisements, photographs, collages, maps, etcetera. There are no limits on content--only limits on format. All submissions must be formatted as a single 8 inch by 10 inch (landscape) image, which contain no more than 100 words of text.",New York,Studio-X NYC
