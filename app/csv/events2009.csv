Safari 7 Reading Room,Tuesday,13,October,2009,Exhibition,Studio-X,"Curated by <strong>Kate Orff</strong> and <strong>Janette Kim</strong>, Urban Landscape Lab, GSAPP + <strong>Glen Cummings</strong>, MTWTF<br />
<br />
Germs, oysters, dogs, chickens, worms and humans are some of the species that populate the length of the MTA&#39;s 7 train--affectionately known as the &quot;International Express&quot; to its riders in Manhattan and Queens--a physical, urban transect through New York City&#39;s most diverse range of ecosystems. The 7 line runs from Manhattan&#39;s dense core, under the East River, and through a dispersed mixture of residences and parklands (including Sunnyside Gardens and the 1939 and 1964 World&#39;s Fair grounds), terminating in downtown Flushing, Queens: the nation&#39;s most ethnically diverse community.<br />
<br />
Led by the Urban Landscape Lab at Columbia University GSAPP, Safari 7 began in the summer of 2009 as a series of podcasts and cartographic explorations of the complexity, biodiversity, conflicts and potentials of New York&#39;s ecosystems, and of New Yorkers&#39; relationships the animal life around them. Materials were made available for self-guided tours, or through tours and workshops organized by the Urban Landscape Lab, which imagined subway cars as eco-urban classrooms and invited travelers to act as park rangers in their own city.<br />
<br />
Opening in conjunction with the conference &quot;ECOGRAM II: Architecture for a Crowded Planet,&quot; the &quot;Safari 7 Reading Room&quot; at Studio-X brings these subway classrooms to Studio-X through a series of maps, interactive tabletops and curated collections of books, where visitors may learn more about urban nature and transportation infrastructure as means of ecological and community engagement.<br />
<br />
<strong>ECOGRAM II: Architecture for a Crowded Planet</strong> is the second annual conference in a series that examines sustainability in the built environment and in architectural education chaired by <strong>Mitchell Joachim</strong> and <strong>Ioanna Theorcharopoulou</strong>, GSAPP + Parsons the New School for Design<br />

Following previous debates in Venice and Mumbai, this (third of four planned debates) North American installment of the Netherlands Architecture Institute&#39;s &quot;Debate on Tour&quot; series will focus on the relation of short-stay visitors -- via tourism or business -- to the form, function, use and future of the cities of the Gulf. How do these places accommodate short stays? What parallels or differences emerge in comparison to the short-stay capital of the world, New York City?<br />
<br />
The discussions that emerge from the four global debates will inform the forthcoming publication &quot;Al Manakh 2: Export Gulf,&quot; a collaborative investigation into Gulf cities by the NAi, OMA-AMO, PinkTank (Dubai) and &quot;Volume Magazine.&quot;<br />

The event will be held in the amorphous GSAPP (Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation) Beijing studio space&ndash; located in a traditional hutong neighborhood near the Lama Temple&ndash;a space dedicated to hosting events and fostering creativity in the Beijing community.

墨&nbsp; &ldquo;Ink&rdquo;&ndash;a discussion of the varied conceptual and material aspects of ink&ndash; in painting, in calligraphy, and in architectural drawing. 墨黑 Inkiness blackens with pigment and tone, yet materializes all the variations of hue in the nuances of black. In concentration and dilution, to ink in is to implicate density, to suggest form with substance, to unify volume and movement. Inky suggests depth and darkness, in shade and shadow, in silhouette, yet one must infuse the brush with light. 翰墨 Opaque, obscured, murky&ndash; ink insinuates&ndash;from a glimpse of the hidden or secret, to the glimmering insight made through implication and allusion.&nbsp; In thickness and fineness, ink intimates hidden relations between concrete things in the embodied gesture, drawing a coherent path in the stroke from the apparent disorder of phenomena.&nbsp; To ink is to follow the inner lines of things to delineate an external reality. 墨水 An inkling mingles intuition with experience, cognition with recognition, perception with apprehension.&nbsp; An enquiry through ink probes and tests, prompting and reminding through inspection and introspection. In verve and reserve, to ink is to incarnate the rhythms and irrepressible instincts of situation and of imagination.&nbsp; Mastered by practice, yet manifest the spontaneous, ink flows in the steady rhythm of gestures, unbroken. 飞白A coherent network, with an implicit factor of emptiness that allows it to function ink is both a potential material, and material potentiality. Instantaneous and rhythmic, sensual and varied in aspect, harmonious or contrasting in structure&mdash;a philosophy in action&mdash; ink may incite a similarly moderated discussion of relations between abstraction and figuration; of oscillations between the material and the conceptual; of locality and temporality in indexical marks and associative meanings. 墨&nbsp; &lsquo;m&ograve;&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;ink,&rsquo; black, pigment, handwriting or painting, learning 墨黑 &lsquo;m&ograve;hei&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;black,&rsquo; pitch-dark 翰墨 &lsquo;h&agrave;nm&ograve;&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;brush + ink,&rsquo; writing, painting, calligraphy (literary) 墨水 &lsquo;m&ograve;shui&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;ink + water,&rsquo; learning 飞白 &lsquo;feib&aacute;i&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;flying white&rsquo; in brushstroke, rhetorical effectiveness in using incorrect words",Beijing,Studio-X Beijing

No-Body Zone: Designing an Exploded Audiobook,Tuesday,14,July,2009,[object Object],Studio-X,"No-Body Zone expanded out of Richard Foreman&rsquo;s 1997 novel-in-parts &ldquo;No-Body.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
From their statement:<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Can a media city-structure be built out of this book? We divided an audiobook recording among seven narrators, mostly previous Foreman actors. Using the recording process as a concrete method, and the narrators&#39; bodies, histories, and recollections as a starting point, we gathered a spectrum of films, scripts, photos, recollections, city diagrams and material ephemera. Thus we tried to plan our city &ndash; and instead lost ourselves in spinning a paranoid web of incidentally connected work around the hermetic mythos of Foreman&#39;s theater -- a kind intertextual multi-lived hodge-podge/bricolage.<br />
<br />
Like all hermetic projects, our No-Body archive shimmers with blind alleys, broken signs, and exploding hearts. In the liminal space between city and reverberation machine -- audiobook performance, hypertext plays, hard drive distribution, theatrical performance -- our audiobook, our website, and our thumbdrive vibrate together as No-Body. Our accreting remains in-process.<br />
<br />
The Studio-X evening will produce another media artifact to be archived and broadcasted: we will film the discussion and a performance of the new play &#39;Eastern/Western Meat Lessons&#39; by Stephen Mosblech, a fragment-blending of Foreman&#39;s text and others, designed for the Studio-X space.&rdquo;<br />

InDisposed,Friday,15,May,2009,Exhibition,Studio-X,"InDisposed: Friday, May 15 through Wednesday, May 20.<br />
<br />
An off-site design exhibition taking place at Studio-X during the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF), InDisposed highlights the twin dichotomies that define contemporary design today: sustainability versus wastefulness, and preciousness versus mass production. To help spark a thoughtful and lively dialogue about these issues, we invited innovative thinkers in a range of media&mdash;from furniture and graphic designers to fine artists and musicians&mdash;to envision an eco-friendly design that addresses notions of disposability, waste, and/or wastefulness. We challenged them to create pieces that are made from environmentally sustainable materials, portable (considering the object&rsquo;s intended use), able to be disposed of in a responsible and convenient way, and conceivably able to be mass-produced. At the end of the show, all pieces will be ceremoniously recycled, upcycled, composted, or otherwise responsibly disposed of.<br />

The Geography of Buzz: Visualizing Cultural Space in New York and Los Angeles,Tuesday,7,April,2009,Exhibition,Studio-X,"<strong>Elizabeth Currid</strong> (University of Southern California, School of Policy, Planning, and Development) and <strong>Sarah Williams</strong> (Columbia University, GSAPP) took a unique dataset, the Getty Image Database, and transformed it to explain the spatial patterns of cultural industries. By geo-referencing, coding, and performing statistical analysis on 6,000 events and 300,000 photographs taken in New York and Los Angeles, the team has shown that cultural industry events tend to cluster spatially. While the data might illustrate what we already know&mdash;that certain &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in the city exist&mdash;investigating them in this way allowed them to gain a better understanding of why clustering occurs in certain localities.<br />
<br />
Analysis of the data showed that those actors not conventionally involved in city development (paparazzi, marketers, media) have unintentionally played a significant role in city development. They also argue that the findings on the cultural industries may tell us something important about the geographical form of industrial social clustering more generally. The use of Getty data provides a new spatial dimension through which to understand both cultural industries and city geographical patterns.<br />

Time: 1:00 &ndash; 5:00 pm<br />
Location: Broadway Theater at MOMA &ndash; Linked Hybrid, Dongcheng District, Beijing<br />
Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) is pleased to invite you to Designing Development Forum 1 (DDF1). The forum will bring together a lively group of experimental architects and progressive developers to discuss the new roles of development and design in China. During the past decade, China has been one of the world&rsquo;s most radical laboratories for innovation in both architecture and development. This forum - the first in an international series - will explore how each field has influenced the other through a time of unprecedented urban expansion.<br />
<br />
DDF1 will document a critical moment of reassessment and redirection in both architecture and development. The seemingly unfettered building boom of the past decade is now being challenged by a global economic downturn. The DDF series of forums will track the new forms of entanglement between development and design as they navigate their way through the rapidly evolving environment. DDF 1 will explore the possible futures of the new paradigm in China, where more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s new buildings are being constructed.<br />
<br />
The forum, which is open to all Columbia alumni, will be divided into two panels. During the break between them, there will be a guided tour by the architects of the remarkable Linked Hybrid megastructure designed by GSAPP faculty member <strong>Steven Holl</strong>, in partnership with <strong>Li Hu</strong>, the Director of GSAPP&rsquo;s Studio-X Beijing.<br />

The spectacle of Beijing&#39;s TVCC tower set ablaze on February 9, 2009 spurred debate about not only regulation and building practice, but also the future of Chinese development. Not long after undergoing international scrutiny for its political and environmental policies in the run-up to the 2008 Olympics--its lasting symbol being the Bird&#39;s Nest--the Chinese state once again experienced international attention that revolved around iconic architecture. Deemed by many to be the end of the &quot;boom,&quot; what does the fire imply for a construction trajectory that has fixated on China as a land of opportunity, and for questions of sustainability and urban development in other Chinese and global cities?<br />

Rapid Response: Addressing The Address,Tuesday,27,January,2009,Rapid Response,Studio-X,"Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) of Columbia University presents, &quot;Rapid Response: Addressing the Address,&quot; with designer and<br />
historian <strong>Mabel O. Wilson</strong>, cultural critic <strong>Andrew Ross</strong>, architect <strong>Reinhold Martin</strong> and political scientist <strong>Dorian Warren</strong>.<br />
<br />
President-Elect Barack Obama&#39;s inauguration will initiate a new era, many believe, in US governance on domestic issues and leadership in global concerns. But how will this administration&#39;s new agenda address the world that architect&nbsp; and planners contend with and imagine? What do Obama&#39;s inaugural statements imply for urban issues?<br />
<br />
Designer and historian <strong>Mabel O. Wilson</strong> will lead this conversation &quot;Addressing the Address&quot; with cultural critic <strong>Andrew Ross</strong>, architect <strong>Reinhold Martin</strong> and political scientist <strong>Dorian Warren</strong>, touching on the environmental concerns of sprawl and new energy needs; the nation&#39;s ailing infrastructure; the spectacular fall of the housing market and potential new programs for homeownership and affordable housing; how new national monuments planned for Washington DC, New York City and elsewhere might address a culture that is increasingly transnational in its makeup; and 21st century racial politics of space made manifest in our cities and borders.<br />

A Few Zines,Thursday,8,January,2009,Opening,Studio-X,"In the 1990s, zines such as Lackluster, Infiltration, loud paper, Dodge City Journal, and Monorail subverted traditional trade and academic architecture magazine trends by crossing the built environment with art, music, politics, and pop culture--and by deliberately retaining and cultivating an underground presence. &nbsp;Much has been made of that decade&#39;s zine phenomenon--inspiring academic studies, international conferences, and DIY workshops--yet little attention has been paid to architectural zine culture specifically, or its resonance within architectural publishing today.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Few Zines: Dispatches from the Edge of Architectural Production&quot; does both. &nbsp;Rather than attempting to present an exhaustive retrospective of architecture zine culture, it highlights complete runs of several noted zines that began in the nineties. &nbsp;The exhibition also features contemporary publications that contnue to draw inspiration from the self-publishing tradition, such as Pin-Up, Sumoscraper, and Thumb.<br />
<br />
To launch this exhibit, curator Mimi Zeiger has published a new issue of loud paper and organized a party and panel discussion, including:<br />
<strong>Luke Bulman</strong>, Thumb<br />
<strong>Felix Burrichter</strong>, Pin-Up<br />
<strong>Stephen Duncombe</strong>, NYU professor and auto of Dream and Notes from Underground: Zines and the Politics of Alternative Culture<br />
<strong>Mark Shepard</strong>, Situated Technologies Pamphlets<br />
