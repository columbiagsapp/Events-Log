Project India Dialogue,Thursday,1,December,2011,Discussion,Studio-X,"<p>An open roundtable dialogue between the 1%-ers &amp; local artists/curators/art theorists/cultural institutionsregarding their recent series of works in Mumbai &amp; the nature of the cross-cultural collaborative project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#39;Project India&#39; is the current leg of the &#39;Banality &amp; Big Questions&#39; tour. It is a collaborative venture between the 1%-ers Art Collective and Asia Art Projects, which sets out to examine new ways for artists to work both cross-culturally and collaboratively. The project will initially take the form of a series of residencies, exhibitions and events in both established and unconventional venues in Mumbai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project begins with a short artist residency at Space 118, Mumbai, where the 1%-ers, featuring a collection of contemporary UK artists, writers and creative practitioners, will respond to the city and collaborate with local Indian artists to create new artworks. These pieces will be shown together with recent works, which showcase each individual&#39;s current practice, to form a series of non-commercial exhibitions and events, culminating in a two-week arts festival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme of events taking place in Mumbai will later develop in Nottingham (UK) throughout various venues across the city in March 2012.</p>

Night School: SubSeries,Saturday,19,November,2011,Night School,Studio-X,"<p>In this next installment of the Studio-X NYC Night School series you will have the opportunity to learn how to put together your own collaborative, speculative urban design provocation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last year, architects and designers <strong>Elizabeth Lasater</strong> and <strong>Nico Weiss </strong>of BAUKUNST teamed up to co-organize SUBSERIES, a project that gathered and focused the design intelligence of 23 emerging New York-based architects, planners, artists, and writers in order to re-imagine 11 subway stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Saturday&#39;s Night School, Lasater and Weiss will lead a tour, discussion, and design charrette that will showcase SubSeries as a prototype for your own future collaborative efforts to generate new spatial strategies to improve the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#39;ll meet at 2:30pm at Houston St. subway station for a tour (cost: one Metrocard swipe), before returning to Studio-X NYC for discussion and a hands-on design workshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are welcome (no special equipment or design qualifications necessary), and coffee, cookies, and coaching will be provided to aid the creative process!</p>

Thrilling Wonder Stories 3 - Day 2,Saturday,29,October,2011,Panel,Studio-X,"<p>Since 2009, an annual <a href=""http://www.thrillingwonderstories.co.uk/""><em>Thrilling Wonder Stories</em></a> event has taken place at the <a href=""http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/"">Architectural Association</a> in London, bringing people together from multiple disciplines to explore the spaces between science, fiction, and design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one hand, these events take the form of an extended look into the role of architectural spaces-including real buildings, but also film sets, computer game environments, and spatial simulations-in propelling, staging, catalyzing, or otherwise framing narrative storylines. This requires speaking not only to architects, but to novelists, game developers, screenwriters, film set designers, and even Hollywood directors to discuss their own particular requirements of, and relationships to, the built environment-but also to ask, more specifically, how the spaces they design, describe, feature, or build affect the development of narrative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the cultural dimension of the event-the &quot;wonder stories.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>Thrilling Wonder Stories</em> has also looked both to science and science fiction as resources of ideas that might play spatial roles in future design projects-where I use the word spatial, not architectural, very deliberately, so as not to limit this to a discussion of buildings. This means bringing in robot makers and biologists, geologists and geneticists, not to ask them about architecture but simply to learn about their work. The point, in other words, is not to extract architectural ideas from their research-as if fully formed building programs could somehow be pulled from a presentation about synthetic organisms-but simply to add to the overall mix of scientific (and science fictional) ideas available for reference in future design conversations.</p>

Public Horizon Exhibition: Opening Reception,Thursday,13,October,2011,Exhibition,Studio-X,"<p>Public Horizon is an exhibition of design proposals for a temporary, open-air panorama in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p><br />
	From pastures to pleasure grounds to protest sites, public space has changed with the modern city. It emerged as a desire for a society of free individuals, sharing experiences and conversations. But it can often be an afterthought, underfunded and over-restricted. Are existing notions of public space still useful, or what should we replace them with? How can we re-articulate common ground while celebrating our diversity in new ways? How can the activities imagined by urban parks be reconceived?</p>
<p><br />
	The Urban Landscape Lab, led by<strong> Janette Kim</strong> and<strong> Erik Carver</strong> and commissioned by the Hudson Square Connection Business Improvement District, designed a 360 cylindrical display device to allow for collective experiments within a panoramic environment. Designers from Columbia University&#39;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation have designed site specific-installations that would test out replacements for traditional public space. 30 design proposals, including the four winning schemes, will be exhibited here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a historical trend, people across the world have been moving from the countryside to cities. 70% of the world&#39;s population will be urban by 2050, compared to only 10% a century ago. China and India are no exception, but the ways in which these two countries are undergoing urbanization are very different. This presentation examines urban governance in Shanghai and Mumbai, two post-colonial port cities that are comparable in size. Join us for an exploration of differing strategies and outcomes of urban citizenship, housing and public manifestations of religion. We will investigate theories of citizenship, civil society, and the public sphere in relation to issues of development.<br />

	The refrain &quot;everything has changed&quot; echoed throughout public life in the wake of September 11, 2001. International attention focused on the symbolic architectural response at Ground Zero, which became the center of a wide-raging public discussion that affected architecture in New York more broadly during the ensuing decade. By displaying excerpts from procedures such as design reviews, civic forums, and marketing alongside the photographic portraits of eleven representative architectural projects around a forty-eight foot long communal table in Columbia University&#39;s Avery Hall caf&eacute;, <em><strong>Public Matters: New York Architecture after 9/11</strong></em> invites audiences to reconsider architecture&#39;s role as a matter of public concern during a period of dramatic historical change.

	<strong>FIELD GUIDE OVEVIEW:</strong> <em>Geologic City: a Field Guide to the GeoArchitecture of New York</em> takes you to 20 sites where you can sense the geologic pulse of New York City. With the field guide in hand, residents and visitors are able to interact with both unfamiliar and iconic New York architecture and infrastructure in unexpected ways: by sensing for themselves the forces and flows of geologic material that give form to the built environment of the City. The City&#39;s architecture and infrastructure depends upon extractions of geologic materials that took millennia to form. Yet, we have virtually no cultural awareness of this reality. Some people argue that this is because humans are cognitively incapable of imagining deep time. We disagree. With this field guide, we offer a speculative tool that humans can use to project their imaginations into deep time as they move through the City. We believe that as works made in response to geologic time become more common, human capacities to design, imagine, and live in relation to deep time will expand.<br />

Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo,Tuesday,14,June,2011,Book Launch,Studio-X,"<strong>About the book:</strong><br />
<br />
When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface in July of 1969, they wore spacesuits made by Playtex: twenty-one layers of fabric, each with a distinct yet interrelated function, custom-sewn for them by seamstresses whose usual work was fashioning bras and girdles. This book is the story of that spacesuit. It is a story of the Playtex Corporation&rsquo;s triumph over the military-industrial complex&mdash;a victory of elegant softness over engineered hardness, of adaptation over cybernetics.<br />
<br />
Playtex&rsquo;s spacesuit went up against hard armor-like spacesuits designed by military contractors and favored by NASA&rsquo;s engineers. It was only when those attempts failed&mdash;when traditional engineering firms could not integrate the body into mission requirements&mdash;that Playtex, with its intimate expertise, got the job.<br />

Spacesuit tells the story of the twenty-one-layer spacesuit in twenty-one chapters addressing twenty-one topics relevant to the suit, the body, and the technology of the twentieth century. He touches, among other things, on eighteenth-century androids, Christian Dior&rsquo;s New Look, Atlas missiles, cybernetics and cyborgs, latex, JFK&rsquo;s carefully cultivated image, the CBS lunar broadcast soundstage, NASA&rsquo;s Mission Control, and the applications of Apollo-style engineering to city planning. The twenty-one-layer spacesuit, de Monchaux argues, offers an object lesson. It tells us about redundancy and interdependence and about the distinctions between natural and man-made complexity; it teaches us to know the virtues of adaptation and to see the future as a set of possibilities rather than a scripted scenario.<br />

Women in Housing and Finance,Thursday,5,May,2011,Forum,Studio-X,"Please join Women in Housing and Finance for a thought-provoking forum on the extensive applications and benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology from the architect&#39;s, construction manager&#39;s, and owner/developer&#39;s perspectives.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;BIM&rdquo; refers to dynamic building modeling software that goes beyond 3-D, utilizing time as the 4th dimension and cost as the 5th, to increase productivity in design and construction and improve ease of building maintenance for the long term.<br />
<br />
BIM creates value through project team integration, improved visualization and clash detection, scheduling and sequencing, and cost estimating and can ultimately lead to shorter timelines and reduced costs.<br />
<br />
Our co-sponsor, Microdesk, will kick off the evening with an overview of this powerful technology, to be followed by a lively discussion among our panelists about BIM&rsquo;s potential to transform design, development and delivery.<br />
AIA/CES continuing education credits (2 LUs) will be offered for this event.<br />

"People’s Architecture: Hsieh Ying-chun, Architect",Saturday,26,March,2011,Exhibition,Studio-X,"This exhibition looks back on the career of Taiwanese architect <strong>Hsieh Ying-chun</strong> and the conceptual framework which has guided his practice of social architecture: &ldquo;the question of housing for 70% of humanity.&rdquo; In the face of accelerated urban development, Hsieh and his collaborators have championed rural community construction projects using local materials, and the preservation of vernacular building forms.<br />
<br />
The month-long exhibition covers 80 works from the famed &ldquo;Bug Dome&rdquo; built at the 2009 Hong Kong/Shenzhen Architecture Biennale, to reconstruction projects in the wake of the 88 flood in Taiwan and the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan. It is these reconstruction efforts which most poignantly raise the question of how to humanely house rural populations, and which mostly plainly demonstrate the potential for architecture to become a practice of empowerment for an entire community.<br />
