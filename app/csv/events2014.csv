NY-LON SKYPE ,Wednesday,30,April,2014,Roundtable Discussion,Studio-X,"This round-table conversation, held simultaneously in both New York and London and brought together by a video wall, is the first in a series of panel discussions that seeks to interrogate the strong and multi-stranded trans-Atlantic corridor that links these two cities. Over-developed and architecturally conservative, is the undeniable global strength of these two western heavyweights soon to be surpassed by accelerated architectural developments in emerging economies such as China and Russia? Or does the strength of their global alliance render them unassailable? The discussion seeks to unpack these questions and to identify the particular strands that make up this special thoroughfare.<br />
<br />
This series of conversations are intended to culminate in a year-long design studio formed as an exchange between Columbia and the AA.<br />
<br />
This first discussion is intended to open up a broad discussion about the remit of such a studio and the potential topics of investigation. In particular we will look at NYLON threads in terms of history and of the architectural profession specifically.<br />

<br />
For centuries, ports and harbors have played a seminal role in the development of commerce and cities. They evolved as a means of defense and of transportation&mdash;for both goods and people. Waterfronts were intense zones of use, dominated by piers, warehouses, markets and manufacturing workshops. Industrialization and increases in trade only reinforced the significance of water access, and harbors became an even more important asset of cities.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the last half century, however, changes in shipping and trade have fundamentally reshaped the physical relationship between port areas and the cities that grew up around them. Advances in land transportation, new technologies for cargo handling, and the physical space required by containerization made many inner-city port facilities obsolete, drastically reducing the number of people whose livelihoods are made along the shore.<br />
<br />
These changes have been felt by cities around the world, some as early as the 1960s and 1970s and some only more recently. Yet despite the disparity in time, the challenge has been the same: how to reclaim the waterfront for development, recreation or culture in a way that synthetically reconnects it to the city and the people it serves. Doing so is not a simple matter of physical planning; it often involves overcoming the challenges of contaminated lands, reluctant neighboring communities and environmental regulation that closely circumscribes what can be built (or rebuilt) in or along the water.<br />
<br />
The reactivation of redundant &ldquo;working waterfront&rdquo; lands occurred first in industrially advanced countries in Europe and the US, in cities such as New York and London. Containerization left central city dockyards and piers silent, and the second half of the twentieth century saw ambitious&mdash;and not always successful&mdash;efforts to repurpose them. Today, similar changes are taking place in rapidly industrializing and growing cities in the Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America. The different stages and nature of such transformation processes will be the subject of the one-day symposium From Port to People: Reinventing Urban Waterfronts, which will look closely at the experience of waterfront redevelopment in four cities: Istanbul, Mumbai, New York, and Rio de Janeiro.<br />
<br />
As early as the 1970s, New York spearheaded waterfront redevelopment, revitalizing parts of lower Manhattan through development projects such as Battery Park City and the South Street Seaport. Since then, other parts of New York&rsquo;s formerly working waterfront have been rezoned from non-residential uses to mixed-use, and redevelopment is taking place at a fast pace. Spurred in part by the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, Rio de Janeiro is moving ahead with a wildly ambitious plan to redevelop a major segment of its urban port zone&mdash;including the construction of underground roadways, new rail lines and significant new commercial development. Istanbul is likewise moving forward on significant waterfront projects, including the recent privatization of one of its former commercial ports as part of an effort to create a new district for tourism. In contrast, Mumbai&rsquo;s waterfront has long been overlooked as part of the city&rsquo;s development plans&mdash;though the opening of a new subway along the eastern side of the city has focused attention on the potential of the city&rsquo;s eastern waterfront.<br />
<br />
The symposium will consider these realized, ongoing, and planned waterfront revitalization projects, investigating the challenges and opportunities that waterfront development presents for planners, developers and cities. Focusing among other areas on governance, finance, transportation planning, and design, panelists will explore what these waterfront cities can learn from each other in an effort to identify solutions and ideas that can help ease the exciting transition along the waterfront &ldquo;from port to people.&rdquo;<br />

10&ndash;11am<br />
<strong>Urban Mobility: Access to and from the Waterfront</strong><br />
The first panel discusses the link that exists between waterfront uses, infrastructure and development. Creating access to the waterfront plays a crucial role in the implementation and success of redevelopment projects, bringing people to and from jobs, recreation, and living&mdash;particularly in areas with no pre-existing infrastructure. How do you connect people from both the city&rsquo;s heart and outlying areas to the old and new waterfront and beyond? The panel will examine issues of job access, infrastructure, governance, and management.<br />

<strong>Envisioning &amp; Financing Development</strong><br />
In this panel, real estate developers will examine the strategies that guide their investments in waterfront developments. How are they different from typical developments? What are the risks? How have waterfront developments been financed? How do local regulations (e.g. coastal zoning laws) influence investment strategies? The panel will compare the underlying economic context, finance mechanisms, and development approaches in the four cities.<br />

<strong>Identifying the Legal and Regulatory Framework</strong><br />
The first panel sets the stage by discussing the various political challenges and legal hurdles that frame waterfront development, identifying the factors that impact the speed and nature of waterfront projects. What are the different levels of government and types of oversight involved in the planning and implementation of redevelopment schemes? Issues of governance, development rights, land-use regulations and ownership will be covered.<br />

<strong>From Port to People: Shaping Public Space</strong><br />
It is people who create successful urban spaces. How do we design waterfronts for the public&rsquo;s access, use and benefit? What is the role of community and cultural heritage in the creation of new urban conditions? The panel will discuss various strategies proposed by designers and planners that enable the activation and transformation of these waterfronts to benefit more than just the development community alone.<br />

<strong>Now What? Planning for the Future</strong><br />
Having discussed a wide range of issues and case studies, this last panel explores ideas and lessons that may be transferred from one place to another. How might the experiences of an &lsquo;early adapter&rsquo; like New York or an &lsquo;innovator&rsquo; like Rio help structure thinking about waterfront developments still in very early stages, e.g. the eastern waterfront in Mumbai? How do specific local contexts hinder or limit such transfer of ideas and knowledge?<br />

Emerging evidence suggests that the urban environment also plays a substantial role in how we feel, think, and behave.&nbsp; This understanding animates scholarship that must, definitionally, exist at the interstice of public health and urban planning/architecture. It is the intent of this meeting to explore these intersections.<br />

Água Carioca ,Thursday,10,April,2014,Exhibition Opening,Exhibitions,"Exhibition of the dutch practice OOZE presents alternative proposals for water treatment in Rio de Janeiro.&nbsp; The opening will be followed by the launch of the documentary &Aacute;gua Carioca, followed by a debate.<br />
<br />
about &Aacute;gua Carioca exhibition:<br />
Constructed Wetlands are natural, self-sufficient and decentralized water treatment systems that imitate natural digestivhe processes in the way they allow microorganisms to unfold their purifying power. In close cooperation with Dutch experts in water technology and commissioned by various institutions across Europe, OOZE has realized several of such systems under various circumstances over recent years. The project &Aacute;gua Carioca makes use of this expertise and expands it: it analyses how Constructed Wetlands may contribute to improve water purification in the city of Rio de Janeiro, more specifically in its informal settlements and speculates how this could be implemented on a large scale, covering the whole&nbsp; State of Rio de Janeiro around the Guanabara Bay. The analysis resulted in four designs for four different neighborhoods, which demonstrate how these systems may look like when being implemented across the city. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with inhabitants and received support of several non-governmental and governmental organizations.&nbsp; Comments, questions and recommendations made by stakeholders are an integral part of the outcome. While maps and plans discuss physical potentialities and barriers, quotations of their remarks highlight institutional chances and challenges.<br />
<br />
about &Aacute;gua Carioca di&aacute;rios documentary:<br />
&ldquo;&Aacute;gua Carioca di&aacute;rios&rdquo; is a film that investigates through a series of interviews the problem of water supply, water management and sewage treatment in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The film shows how a distributed system of wetlands could potentially eliminate these problems in an economical and sustainable way.<br />

OOZE architects &amp; urbanists:<br />
OOZE&nbsp; is an international design practice operating in the fields of architecture and urbanism, based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and founded by Eva Pfannes and Sylvain Hartenberg in 2003. OOZE combines an elaborate understanding of natural, ecological processes with technological expertise and deep insights into the social-cultural behavior of users of the built environment. Their design and research projects, constructed in collaborative processes that balance imaginations of futures with urgent, current needs, are transformative tools at the hand of agents. They allow users to appropriate a space and develop it further. OOZE strives to be a catalyst for change and believe that change is incremental. Each project, each art installation, building, public space or urban structure is both, the product of a way of living and an idea of&nbsp; adapting this way of living to achieve a more social and ecological sustainability. The cyclic processes found in nature form the base for each intervention and integrate the human scale within a holistic urban strategy.<br />
Work of OOZE has been realized in some European and Asian countries and was exhibited during several international cultural events, among them the Venice Biennial in 2012. Ooze has received numerous awards, including the prestigious Dutch Basis Prix de Rome for Architecture in 2006.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

Local Actions for Global Effects: Local Air-Pollution Control as Global Carbon- Mitigation Strategy,Wednesday,9,April,2014,Lecture,Urban Planning,"<div>
	To deal with climate change, controlling greenhouse gases (GHGs) has increasingly taken priority on the global community&rsquo;s policy agenda. Global negotiation for GHG control, however, has not yet ended up with legally binding actions. At the center of this failure is the leakage issue: controlling GHGs carries substantial local costs, but benefits from it will be shared by other countries. In particular, developing countries, which often place emphasis on economic development over any other policy goal, tend to be passive in joining the global effort for GHG mitigation. In this context, existing co-benefit studies have attempted to persuade them by emphasizing that GHG control is much less costly than conventionally assumed, considering the ancillary air-quality benefits from it. Nonetheless, many developing countries are still skeptical about this logic. In this talk, I emphasize the reverse of the prevalent policy logic: local air-pollution control as a global GHG mitigation strategy is more sensible than GHG mitigation as a local air-quality improvement facilitator.<br />

Dr. Nam&rsquo;s&nbsp;research interest in the institutional and policy dimensions of economic and&nbsp;environmental sustainability has produced 11 research articles published in major&nbsp;peer-reviewed journals, such as Industrial and Corporate Change and Global&nbsp;Environmental Change.

Interpretations: Critical Shifts ,Saturday,5,April,2014,Symposium,CCCP,"Critical Shifts is a one-day, student-organized symposium dedicated to exploring the ongoing transformations of critical practice in architecture. The event brings together a diverse group of practitioners in order to investigate how their work (which often combines the activities and approaches of curation, editing, writing, design, teaching, and research) can begin to trace a nuanced map of the fieldʼs current critical terrain.<br />
<br />
Understanding this terrain as an active landscape perpetually in formation, the symposium is not concerned with developing totalizing statements about the state of criticism or criticality in architecture. Instead it intends to survey the terrain mapped by its speakers in order to identify, describe, and assess the multiple processes and energies that are actively shaping it. What sorts of critical shifts are happening within the discipline today, and how do they help expand and redefine our understandings of &ldquo;criticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;critique,&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical&rdquo;? What changes in modes of architectural practice do they evidence (fractures, amalgamations, transformations, etc.)? And what do these shifts indicate about architectureʼs current relationship with the public, and thereby the scope of its critical concern and reach?<br />
<br />
The symposiumʼs speakers will help us consider these questions across traditional sites of production&mdash;the School, the Journal, the Institute, the Studio, the Magazine, and the Museum (fully recognizing that their operations may no longer be so traditional)&mdash;as well as contemporary sites such as the Blog and Biennale.<br />

Charles Bessard - Powerhouse Company,Wednesday,26,March,2014,Lecture,Studio-X,"This talk will be held in English / Bu etkinlik İngilizce&rsquo;dir.<br />
<br />
Conscious of the gap between high and low culture, theory and design the Powerhouse Company neither only wants to build, nor just to theorize on the reasons for a new architecture, but instead bring back architecture as an encompassing, constructive and innovative practice. Powerhouse Company aims at re-locating the practice of architecture at the cross-roads between design, research and education.<br />
<br />
<em>&ldquo;We are an office of modern architecture and paradoxically that sounds old-fashioned. After all wasn&rsquo;t the modernist agenda about making things better for everyone? Back then the question was how to provide everyone with light, air and space. But today the questions are no-longer single sided. Now, design can be on the one hand a question of ceiling integrated video beamers, rain-forest showers and play-station rooms &ndash; yet it can also be a question of designing hooligan-proof public space that gives place to our culturally rich modern society. For us, these times ask for both exclusive and inclusive designs: specific buildings and objects that embrace the richness of reality and charge their contexts with new means and meanings.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
Powerhouse Company is a international architectural practice established in Copenhagen (DK) and Rotterdam (NL). The office was founded in 2005 by two partners: Charles Bessard in Denmark and Nanne de Ru in Holland. Both partners have forged their experience and skills in internationally renowned practices such as Atelier Jean Nouvel and OMA Rem Koolhaas. Powerhouse Company is a medium sized office developing an international profile with projects in Denmark, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Cyprus and China.<br />
<br />
The work of Powerhouse Company has been exhibited at the Guggenheim museum in New York, the Cooper Hewitt museum in New York, the Maxxi in Rome and the Netherlands Architecture Institute in Rotterdam&nbsp; as well as various biennales such as the 2005 Rotterdam Architecture Biennale, the 2010 Shenzen Bienale and the 8th Sao Paulo Biennale of Architecture. Projects and texts of Powerhouse Company have been published in various magazines such as Domus, A+U, Mark Magazine, A10 and The New York Times.<br />
<br />
Powerhouse Company has been awarded several prizes over the last 7 years.In 2012 we received Nykredit the motivation price in Copenhagen. In 2008 Powerhouse Company has been awarded the Dutch Design Award 2008 for the category &lsquo;best private interior design&rsquo;, the AM/NAi prize for the best building by architects under 40 and the Prix Speciale for best office of Ecole Superieur d&rsquo;Architecture in Paris. The office was shortlisted for the prestigious Mies van der Rohe Award 2009 and 2011, the Chernikov prize 2010 and the Marcus Prize of Milwaukee University, USA. In 2011 Powerhouse Company was awarded the Young Maaskantprijs.<br />

Stitching together a public in the midst of demographic complexity: The limits and possibility of civic technology.,Tuesday,25,March,2014,Lecture,Studio-X,"This talk will be held in English / Bu etkinlik İngilizce&rsquo;dir.<br />
<br />
Cities are places where diversity is taken for granted. By and large in cities we expect the public sphere to be heterogeneous, a mixture of cultures, race, sexual orientations, etc. While each of us may not know how to negotiate this demographic complexity it is a fact of the day to day life of cities. This presentation is based on a simple assertion that reveals a complex problem. The assertion: civic engagement and civic inclusion are not equivalent concepts. Civic engagement often refers to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; as if the public is a unified body of people. In truth cities are made up of people who belong to different publics. Those concerned with civic inclusion ask the question; How do we design engagement technologies so that the complexity of who we are as a public is not hidden but revealed? Herein lies the problem. Various studies have suggested that heterogeneity does not lead to greater engagement. In fact, these studies find that people participate more in civic activities when they live and connect with people who are more like themselves. Moreover, our institutional arrangements, tend to further segregate people not only from each other, (the poor go to welfare offices for housing vouchers the rich to real estate brokers,) but from themselves. The office that supports the poor through the process does not simultaneously assist in your health care, child&#39;s education, or your employability.<br />
<br />
In short, cities are a multi layered segregated societies in which there is a growing hope that civic technology can help stitch together a true &ldquo;public&rdquo;. This multimedia presentation demonstrates how the segregation in the midst of growing diversity creates is a defining dilemma for civic inclusion in cities. The stories in the presentation reveal how in different communities varied technologies, processes and values that are being employed to address the challenge of civic inclusion.<br />

About Ceasar McDowell<br />
<br />
Professor of the Practice f Community Development,<br />
MIT | DUSP<br />
President, Interaction Institute for Social Change<br />
<br />
When asked what his work is about Ceasar always says, &ldquo;Voice.&rdquo; He has a deep and abiding passion for figuring out how people who are systematically marginalized by society have the opportunity to voice their lived experiences to the world. Ceasar believes that until people are able to lift up those experiences, they will be unable to participate as full members of society. Over the past few decades, Ceasar has been involved in many activities to bring this belief to life. As founder of MIT&rsquo;s Co-Lab (previously named Center for Reflective Community Practice), Ceasar works to develop the critical moments reflection method to help communities build knowledge from their practice or, as he likes to say, &ldquo;to know what they know.&rdquo; Through his work at the global civic engagement organization, Engage The Power, he developed The Question Campaign as a method for building democratic communities from the ground up. At MIT, Ceasar teaches on civic and community engagement and the use of social media to enhance both. In addition, he is working to create a model of equitable partnership between universities and communities and to support communities to build their own knowledge base. Ceasar brings his deep commitment to the work of building beloved, just and equitable communities that are able to &ndash; as his friend Carl Moore says - &rdquo;struggle with the traditions that bind them and the interests that separate them so they can build a future that is an improvement on the past.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
As IISC&rsquo;s new president, Ceasar is focused on how best to move the organization toward the social change it has been helping others do in the world. Over the next year, he expects you will begin to see IISC using its tools and methods and deep collaborative and network design and building skills to move equity and social change efforts in a few select sectors.<br />

Clearing is proposed as a strategy to compose an architecture that engages with the built landscape to perform as an extension of the city ground and absorbs the organic nature of its events, infrastructural demands and gestures of improvisation. A new axis of urban equipment, interacting between state infrastructure and local organizations, is proposed along the central valley of Complexo do Alem&atilde;o.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
Favelas & Environment,Thursday,20,March,2014,Lecture,Studio-X,"The health of a population is directly linked to its environment and infrastructural systems. Rio das Pedras has a significant portion of its territory built over unstable low lands around the Tijuca lagoon, without sanitation systems and prone to constant flooding, greatly affecting the lives and health of its population.<br />
<br />
While approaches to urban upgrading become more consensual as a strategy for favelas, new tools, designs and technologies are necessary to fulfill inhabitants&acute; needs and improve living conditions. This conversation will explore the environmental challenges to the lacunar system, combined sanitation &amp; energy generation technology as well as urban health mapping tools.<br />

Favelas & Urban Projects,Wednesday,19,March,2014,Lecture,Studio-X,"Favelas are places built and organized with their own set of rules and protocols. Planning and designing in such a context involves conceptual, legal, technical and cultural challenges which defy standard procedures and regulations. What is the state of the art when it comes to design for the favelas? How can architecture meet such a challenge? What can we learn from past experiences?",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

What types of mechanisms, networks and practices are required to develop sustainable economic and income generation models for the population? How to create relationships between formal and informal markets? The discussion will explore questions, potentials and development perspectives for the future of favelas in general, and Rio das Pedras in particular.<br />

BRUTALISM REVISTED,Tuesday,18,March,2014,X-Talk,Studio-X,"Brutalism is a style of architecture which was part of the International Style of Architecture that demanded a different approach towards architectural design. The term New Brutalism was first applied in 1953 by the British architects, Peter Smithson and Alison Smithson. These two architects along with the artist, Eduardo Paolozzi&nbsp; photographer, Nigel Henderson, Richard Hamilton and James Sterling among others, formed the Independent Group, and in the same year, organized the exhibition &lsquo;Parallel to Life and Art&rsquo; held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. The Independent Group was an informal collective of young artists, designers and critics who gathered for discussions and conversations around art, architectural and urban theory at the ICA from 1952 -55. New Brutalism has come to acquire strong political associations in Sau Paulo and elsewhere, with many architectural projects being conceived in this aesthetic. In some instances, its sublime qualities extend from churches to a flower-shop.<br />
The lecture will consider the ideas of New Brutalism in the context of the Group and the ICA, and the limitations of this conception. Expanding on the origin of the term (Jean Dubuffet), and its relation to certain continental preoccupations with age-old aesthetic qualities, the speaker will connect to other movements such as Outsider Art or Art Brut. This presentation will also seek to connect the recent search for a rhetoric of materiality and temporality with age-old preoccupations in art and architecture, and the debates which brought about the demise of some key buildings, conceived and executed by Brutalists. References will also be made to the Metabolists, which was a group formed by young Japanese architects and city planners in the late 1950s, and as much pioneers as Le Corbusier. In a certain sense, this presentation is conceived as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the subject, and will also discuss such architecture in England and India.<br />

 Rio in the Eye of the Hurricane,Monday,17,March,2014,Lecture,Studio-X,"Forget about the idyllic image of Rio. On the cusp of the World Cup and two years away from the 2016 Olympic Games, the city is in the eye of the hurricane. Caught by international attention it is exposing its contradictions while becoming a global destination. The mega event improvements and the Port Area renovation are challenged by historical social inequality, precarious infrastructure and services, environmental issues - all boosted by the protests which erupted throughout the country since the middle of last year.&nbsp; Daily life has been severely disrupted by the increase of living costs and the urban transformations that turned the city into a construction site.<br />
<br />
Under so much pressure and uncertainty, long term consequences cannot be fully understood by citizens and optimism has been substituted by anxiety towards the near future. What can we expect for the coming years? What will be left after the hurricane is gone? How can we proceed in the face of these transformations? How can we think beyond 2016?",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

R-Urban is a bottom-up strategy initiated by aaa to enhance urban resilience capacity by introducing a network of resident-run facilities which create complementarities between key fields of everyday activities (economy, housing, urban agriculture, culture). R-Urban initiates locally closed ecological cycles that will support the emergence of alternative models of living, producing and consuming between the urban and the rural.<br />
<br />
To overcome the current crises (climate, resources, economic, demographic), we must, as philosopher Andre Gorz says, &lsquo;produce what we consume and consume what we produce&rsquo;. This balance between production and consumption through local sustainable sourcing cannot occur without changes in the way we live.

"Temporary Interventions, Permanent Marks",Thursday,27,February,2014,Book Launch,Studio-X,"The book Temporary Interventions, Permanent Marks: Appropriations, Art and Parties in the Contemporary City, by Adriana Sans&atilde;o, deals with public space through four approaches: temporary interventions and their transformative potential, the value of the ephemeral condition in the contemporary society, the amplified concept of collective space, and the concept of urban amiability, space-time quality of the temporary intervention.&nbsp; Presenting these interventions through three typologies, the spontaneous appropriations, the public art interventions and the local parties, the book sustains the argument that temporary interventions can leave permanent marks, be them material or immaterial, potentializing urban spaces as social locus.<br />
<br />
The good life of the contemporary city contemplates something more than simply the quotidian dimension; and the artistic qualities, festive or subversive that these temporary interventions offer correspond to an exceptionality in the life of urban centers, a special time in a space which is transformed by such.<br />
<br />
One cannot live only through the satisfaction of &quot;mundanities&quot; but also of what is &quot;useless&quot; which is offered to us by temporary interventions and which makes our quotidian something plentiful and original.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

<br />
This interpretation of Peter Cook&rsquo;s Blowout Village (1966) highlights<br />
the relevance of temporary architecture in the face of climate change<br />
and natural disasters. Cook&rsquo;s work is repurposed as a post-disaster<br />
structure for the housing of critical urban institutions. The work is<br />
transformed into an emergency relief product with variable program<br />
options ranging from a temporary hospital to a senior housing facility.<br />
<br />
In this exhibition, the product is sited in Lower Manhattan<br />
(New York City)&nbsp; where it serves as the Emergency Financial<br />
Command and Control Center for the NYSE and NASDAQ. By<br />
maintaining continuity of operations for the financial services<br />
sector, the product redefines the expansive notions of urban<br />
resilience that go beyond mere physical flood protection.<br />
Representation of the product also highlights the financial<br />
implications of a radical form of architecture which is<br />
simultaneously feasible and impractical.<br />
<br />
With a defined sense of insularity to the urban environment, the<br />
product underscores the limitations of the contemporary range of<br />
responsive ecological design solutions which have historically<br />
given little consideration to the continuity of urban systems. This<br />
exhibition highlights the critical need for public awareness of a<br />
larger urban vulnerability to climate change which has the potential<br />
to be mitigated through innovative design and development.<br />

China’s Land Market Reform and its Implication for Brownfield Governance in Rapidly Deindustrialized Urban Areas,Tuesday,4,February,2014,LiPS,LiPS,"This talk takes an interdisciplinary approach to examine the environmental governance of brownfields. In the context of insufficient regulations on the redevelopment of former industrial sites, rapidly de-industrializing urban areas in developing countries, such as China, are in pressing need for innovative mechanisms to ensure a healthy living environment. Through stories of a land redevelopment project over a ten-year period, I demonstrate a shift in China&#39;s environmental governance from a top-down command-and-control regulatory regime to a multilevel system that facilitates consensus building among non-environmental state and civil actors in policy-making. In particular, I argue that this shift with respect to brownfields occurred not simply because of improvements within the environmental apparatus, but because of institutional changes in the land transaction system.<br />

Mimarlar Mezarlığı / Cemetery of Architects,Saturday,1,February,2014,[object Object],Studio-X,"&lsquo;Cemetery of Architects&rsquo; at Studio-X Istanbul<br />
<br />
During January 31st - March 28th, Studio-X Istanbul hosts Tayfun Serttaş&#39;s exhibition &lsquo;Cemetery of Architects&rsquo; and the launch of his book &lsquo;Trilogy of the Deserted City&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
As its second project during January 31st - March 28th, 2014, Studio-X hosts Tayfun Serttaş&#39;s exhibition, &quot;Cemetery of Architects&quot; in which the artist examines the relationship between the physical identity of urban space and the individual through an archive. Studio-X, an initiative of Columbia University, is founded in Istanbul in December 2013 with leading support from Borusan Holding. The exhibition, eponymous with an installation by the artist, brings together works that problematize the impact of historic interruptions on Istanbul&#39;s cultural map. In &quot;Trilogy of the Deserted City&quot;, to be launched in parallel to the opening, the artist shares with the viewers the background of three different projects in which the same historic problem is attempted to be resolved through various media and methodologies. &quot;Cemetery of Architects&quot; exhibition is supported by a six-week public programming under the heading &quot;half-century before, half-century after&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cemetery of Architects<br />
<br />
Architectural inscriptions, which could be read on the corners of buildings in Istanbul in the last quarter of the 19th century, evidence the parallel development of the identity of the individual to modernism. Instead of the anonymous architecture of the period before Westernization, these individual architects felt the need the work on their own, playing a role in forming a professional community in a contemporary sense. In contrast to traditional palace architects, supported by the state, the architects of apartment buildings that primarily work within narrow urban lots give direction to civil architecture with their minor activities. As the empire enters a period of Westernization, the cultural rights provided by the rescript of G&uuml;lhane and the land cleared by the 1870 Pera fire opened up the path to the building of apartment buildings that was necessitated by the new life style; Istanbul&#39;s urban identity is almost re-created with the eclectic style of architectural structures that arose from the synthesis of the European and the Ottoman in the short span of fifty years.<br />
<br />
The modernization of the Republic that refused to take as its heritage previous formations of modernity and the moving of the capital city to Ankara stopped the most revered client&mdash;the state&mdash;from receiving services of projects and design from the industry of architecture, preparing the ground for the architectural interruption experienced in Turkey. The policy of Turkifying the economy that began in the period of the Party of Union and Progress would extend into the early Republic, revising architecture as an area to be conquered. Through the system of thinking that was on the background of the First National Architectural Movement, the re-capturing of this area that was dominated by &quot;others&quot; in the period of the Westernization of the Ottomans was as crucial as the &quot;independence of the country.&quot; The ideology that dictates the re-construction of the concept of the architect through national identity consequents in the absolute erasure of civil architectural heritage and the actors from shared memory.<br />
<br />
Cemetery of Architects proposes to open up to discussion the buildings of the period, some of which are destroyed within plans of urban transformation, through their architects beyond nostalgia and local exoticism as legitimate and indispensable actors with the tools of contemporary research.<br />
<br />
Cemetery of Architects is supported by Silkar Mining and Trading Corporation and Tabanlıoğlu Architects.<br />
<br />
Trilogy of the Deserted City<br />
<br />
Trilogy of the Deserted City is an experiment dedicated to problematize the consequences of the loss of its population and the periodic emigrations from Istanbul&mdash;one of the most crowded cities in the world&mdash;as much as the internal migration that it received, on its cultural memory.<br />
<br />
The aim is not to be relieved of a sense of guilt evoked by the city through putting pieces of unorganized data next to each other. It is to call upon the souls that have remained hanging in its ominous history, disabling the unconscious, confronting the abnormalities, revealing the repressed through skepticism.<br />
<br />
In the three consecutive layers of fake investigation and misdirection, the &quot;desertedness&quot; that is sought, followed, watched, evidenced, researched, interrogated is internalized. Thus the exaggerated urban metaphor becomes a game through a one-person search against the city and collective memory by the individual.<br />

Looking Back on the Bloomberg Way,Tuesday,28,January,2014,LiPS,LiPS,"For over a decade, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed to run the city like a business. In this talk, Julian Brash will examine what that meant. Drawing on his 2011 work, Bloomberg&#39;s New York, he will explore the mayor&rsquo;s attitude toward governance, &quot;the Bloomberg Way&quot;&mdash;a philosophy that held up the mayor as CEO, government as a private corporation, desirable residents and businesses as customers and clients, and the city itself as a product to be branded and marketed as a luxury good. Commonly represented as pragmatic and nonideological, the Bloomberg Way was in fact an ambitious reformulation of neoliberal governance that advances specific class interests. Looking back over Bloomberg&#39;s tenure as mayor, and taking into account Bill de Blasio&#39;s recent election, Brash will discuss the implications of this mode of governance for the present and future of New York City.",New York,"Room 114, Avery Hall"

<strong>THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS</strong><br />
by Rayyane Tabet<br />
<br />
The Trans-Arabian PipeLine Company (TAPLine) was established in 1946 as a joint venture between Caltex, Esso, and Mobil. TAPLine was formed to build and operate a 1213 kilometer long, 78 centimeter wide steel tube to transport oil through land from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, crossing the borders of five political entities in a region that is very conscious of its demarcated lines. In 1983, the line could no longer sustain the pressure from layered and adjacent political interests and the company was dissolved. Today, it sits hidden six feet underground, the objects used to render the company released into a raw form.<br />
<br />
Since 2007 Rayyane Tabet has been looking into the rise and fall of this oil company through these leftover forms and has developed works that analyze the transformation of the region since the end of World War II through the specter of this decommissioned utilitarian tool. This talk will be an introduction to Tabet&#39;s work alongside a brief history of TAPLine.&nbsp;<br />

Rayyane Tabet joins us in Amman as part of his participation in HIWAR | Conversations at Darat al Funun in Amman; an exhibition, residencies, and talks program organized by Darat al Funun and curated by Adriano Pedrosa to celebrate 25 years of support for the arts. HIWAR (meaning conversastion in Arabic) has brought 14 artists from the Arab world, Africa, Asia and Latin America to Amman for residencies in September and October 2013, which culminated in an exhibition opening on Saturday November 9th, 2013 (open through April 2014 -&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.daratalfunun.org/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.daratalfunun.org</a>).&nbsp;<br />

INNOVATING PUBLIC SPACE in Urban India,Saturday,18,January,2014,Panel,Studio-X,"In the rapidly urbanizing cities of India, public spaces are becoming increasingly rare. The occasional garden within the older cities and the neighborhood parks in the newly planned areas. Streets often get appropriated as public spaces with vendors and food stalls or as places for religious processions. Increasingly, gated residential communities, office parks, and malls serve as proxies for public spaces. At the same time, cities that are popularly<br />
considered to be the most livable and with the best quality of life are those that have lively public spaces that are continuously used. Successful public spaces help to make urban environments well-maintained and safe places to live and work.<br />
How can we re-think public spaces in Indian cities today? With no space to make plazas, what are some ways of innovating small public spaces in densely built up metropolitan environments? What activities and meanings would promote inclusive public spaces? This panel discussion will explore these questions by looking at some recent efforts to create public space in Indian cities.<br />
This Panel Discussion is being held in conjunction with a workshop,<br />

10.30 - 18.00 Cross Border Education Workshop: Architectures of Sharing<br />
Studio-X forms a new kind of architecture of sharing as an international workshop, a space for real-time exchange of projects, people and ideas between regional leadership cities. What are the challenges and possibilities of this emerging way of thinking and sharing for a local context? Case Studies will include: Cross border education between Hong Kong-Shenzhen, the recent mass protests on Chinese identity, mixed use districts, creative clusters and the future of institutional collaborations. Discussions will engage with local universities and Columbia University students and faculty, and Studio-X directors.With:<br />

“Concrete Poetry: Conceptual Acts of Architecture in Concrete.” ,Monday,13,January,2014,Opening,Exhibitions,"Michelle Fornabai&#39;s &quot;Tilt: digging to China (holes),&quot; a &quot;concrete poem&quot; cast with local materials on location at Studio X Rio, constructs conceptual holes between Beijing, Tokyo, and Rio which allow the viewer to occupy imaginary landscapes.<br />
<br />
Antipodes are points opposite to each other on the earth, as if one were to dig straight through the center of the earth. Children are often told when digging holes, if they dig deep enough they will dig to China. Actually, if one were to dig a hole straight through from Beijing, one would end up roughly 200 km from Buenos Aires, Argentina (so technically only a child from here could reach Beijing). This installation, &quot;Tilt: digging to China (holes)&quot; constructs conceptual holes between South America and Asia. Each tilted plane in the installation maps to a specific point on the globe, and each panel materializes an imaginary landscape located at this point. A site-specific installation, the castings were made in Rio de Janiero during a six-week residency at Studio X Rio in the weeks prior to exhibition. An &quot;inverse&quot; installation was constructed at the antipodal site in Studio X Beijing, China in October 2013 and exhibited at the Yuan Art Museum.<br />
<br />
The conceptual holes constructed are intensely material in that they are cast in concrete, but must be completed by the viewer both conceptually and experientially. Experientially, holes are strange perceptual objects, which may be enlarged, filled or even moved, yet still understood materially. Whether&nbsp; filled, occupied or emptied, the hole remains intact. Holes maintain an ambiguous status in figure-ground and can be defined as an opening or a concavity, as both space and surface, respectively. Conceptually, whether posited as negative space, absence, or a figure labeled &lsquo;empty&rsquo; or &lsquo;missing,&#39; as complementary reasoning or two-sided like lock and key, as inversions with implications for &lsquo;inside&rsquo; and &lsquo;outside,&rsquo; or as haptic perceptions intertwining both vision and touch, holes are apparent paradoxes which can be perceived without the need to be solved.<br />
<br />
The castings are made of a lightweight concrete called &quot;papercrete,&quot; which uses paper to remove the weight from concrete. The measure of the panels is 2A0 (a module based on one meter square, A0), which typically acts as a large format paper size and conventionally as a smaller format construction module, allowing the panels to exist between representation and material. Each panel at the gallery scale consists of a volume .1m3 of concrete, 1/10 of the 1m3 volume of the panel projected at the landscape scale (full scale). The series of tilted papercrete planes, &quot;Tilt 6.5/Tokyo,&quot; and &quot;Tilt 12.25/Beijing,&quot; can be understood as both an act and an artifact, and represent the second in the decade-long series &quot;Concrete Poetry: 10 Conceptual Acts of Architecture in Concrete.&quot;",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio
