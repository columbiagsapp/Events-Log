"URBAN FUTURES 2030: Heritage, Technology and Sustainability - Beijing | Mumbai | Amman",Monday,17,December,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"Abstract:<br />
In the last two decades, cities and urban forms have experienced unprecedented growth, development, and change especially in many countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. A sense of speed, simultaneity, and complexity accompany urban transformations that are often urgent, incessant, and of gargantuan proportions. Many cities today are paradoxical landscapes of global modernity and poverty; grand technological projects and religious festivals. Many see urban development in these cities as a choice between history and technology; local particularities and globalized universalities; timeless continuity and radical transformation; tradition and modernity. An implicit assumption is that one must be at the cost of the other. The creative processes of building new iconic forms and mega-projects have been accompanied by the destructive un-building of heritage, identity, and the natural environment. Hosagrahar proposes alternative perspectives on ways that globalization and technology intersects with history and heritage towards enhancing sustainable urban futures.<br />

Sink or Swim (SoS): Principles and Priorities in a Post-Sandy Era ,Thursday,13,December,2012,Panel,CURE,"The Center for Urban Real Estate (CURE.) at Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation together with the Municipal Art Society (MAS) are hosting a conference entitled, &ldquo;New York City: Sink or Swim (SoS): Principles and Priorities for Waterfront Restoration in a Post-Sandy Era,&rdquo; which will take place at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan on December 13, 2012 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (EST).<br />
<br />
Sink or Swim (SoS) will define principles and identify priorities for long‐term investments in infrastructure necessary to adapt to the increased risks posed by sea level rise and other climate change impacts in the New York metropolitan region. SoS provides an opportunity to reflect on the delicate balance of managing the immediate needs of community rebuilding in the face of Hurricane Sandy and the long‐term trade‐offs of developing climate adaptive infrastructure. The dialogue of SoS is framed in the context of two panels: technical and mechanical. The technical panel provides a survey of the technical and design interventions available, as well as their corresponding pricing multiples and aggregate costs. SoS seeks to understand what interventions and combinations of interventions are necessary to shape a feasible strategic plan for catalyzing regional investment by both public and private actors. The dialogue then shifts to discussing the potential administrative mechanics and financial implications critical to executing such abroad multijurisdictional vision. SoS will frame a variety of scaled interventions&mdash;from architectural to infrastructural&mdash;that are both accessible and practical.<br />
<br />
The program emphasizes the practical, by including a Dutch delegation led by the Commissioner of the Netherlands Delta Commission. The Dutch can trace their own experiments in water management and economy to the 12th century and today they lead the world in expertise and practical technology. The Dutch balance of soft and hard edge interventions provides a working model for managing environmentally sensitive urban systems. Is America ready to fundamentally adopt a philosophy the Dutch have embraced&mdash; of learning how to live with water and not against it? With this emerging framework SoS hopes to inform, empower and inspire communities and decision makers to reach a consensus about coastal reconstruction that is both holistic over the long‐term and feasible in the shortterm.<br />

<br />
Construction and Collapse is a conversation provoked by works of visual artists Alexandre Vogler and Guga Ferraz for the exhibition Collapse, currently on display in Gentil Carioca Gallery. Both works have strong political connotations and relate to the urban transformations underway in Rio de Janeiro. In the words of curator Felipe Scovino, they &quot;evoke the public space as a place poetically expressive&quot; to &quot;make the public more aware of your surroundings and conditions in which the work of art stands politically.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the work Retrofit (2012), Vogler replicates the sidewalls of the historic building of Gentil Carioca gallery the facades of the new corporate complex Petrobras, lo-cated in the Historic Center, in a critical position on the quality and the impact of that architecture - and its own work, producing a dubious relationship with its surroundings and passersby. According Scovino, the work &quot;questions which are disruptions and cause of the evils of this new urban and architectural process by which the Rio de Janeiro is but at the same time includes a clear potential for ex-clusion and gentrification.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guga Ferraz, in the work in Sky, uses the bottom of Paulo de Frontin highline to create a window next to a small square that reveals that same sky obscured by the structure. The work emphasizes the impact that these major road interven-tions produce in the ambience of the city, and revealing the contradictions of the present moment when demolition of the Perimetral highline happens in parallel to the implantation of similar tstructures or the Bus Rapid Transit system.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

In conversation with <strong>Patrick McCreery,</strong> Gallatin School of Individualized Study, NYU, and <strong>Mabel Wilson,</strong> Columbia University GSAPP</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12px;"">ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) is the pioneering grassroots organization at the forefront of the AIDS activist movement in the 80s and 90s that used direct action politics to bring the crisis to public consciousness. Combining civil disobedience, performance art, and savvy media instincts, ACT UP set the template for staging provocative actions and for transforming governmental and corporate space into sites for social change. The group has been cited as a key influence in the global justice movement, recent anti-war protests, and the current Occupy Wall Street movement. This year marks the 25th anniversary of ACT UP&rsquo;s first action on Wall Street in March 1987. <em>United in Anger: A History of ACT UP</em> (2012) is a feature documentary that presents the story of the organization, from its inception at the LGBT Community Center in the West Village under Larry Kramer&rsquo;s guidance, to the planning and execution of key actions, such as the Stop the Church demonstration at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in 1989, in which some 5,000 participants interrupted Cardinal O&rsquo;Conner&rsquo;s Sunday Mass in support of AIDS education, gay civil rights and women&rsquo;s reproductive rights.<br />
<br />
Following the screening, there will be a conversation on activism and urban space with director Jim Hubbard, designer and historian Mabel Wilson, GSAPP, and Patrick McCreery, whose work explores the culture of politics and sexuality and family life.</span><br />

One lesson that has been learned over the past twenty years, however, is never to say never again, for now the American Wing is embarking on the installation of yet another aesthetic interior from the 1880s, the Rockefeller Dressing Room, a recent gift from the Museum of the City of New York.

Book Launch: Making the Geologic Now,Wednesday,5,December,2012,Book Launch,Studio-X,"In the spirit of a broadside, this edited collection circulates images and short essays from over 40 artists, designers, architects, scholars, and journalists who are extending our active awareness of inhabitation out to the cosmos and down to the Earth&rsquo;s iron core. Their works are offered as test sites for what might become thinkable and possible if humans were to take up the geologic as our instructive co-designer&mdash;as a partner in designing thoughts, things, systems, and experiences. As a reading and viewing event, <em>Making the Geologic Now</em> is designed to move with its audiences while delivering signals from unfolding edges of the &ldquo;geologic now.&quot; It offers early sightings of an increasingly widespread turn toward the geologic as source of explanation, motivation, and inspiration for creative responses to material conditions of the present moment.<br />

PechaKucha Night Rio: Tecnomacumba against the Exu of Ignorance,Wednesday,28,November,2012,Forum,Studio-X,"The title PechaKucha comes from the japanese term for &lsquo;chatting&rsquo; and is based on a simple idea: 20 images X 20 seconds, a format which allows for objective and con-cise presentations.<br />
PechaKucha started out in Tokyo in 2003 through the architecture office of Klein-Dytham, and was meant for architects and designers to meet and share their work.&nbsp; It has since become a global celebration embraced by a myriad of creative minds involved in all matters of architecture, art, technology and culture.&nbsp; With events hap-pening in hundreds of cities around the world PechaKucha has become a portal of creative exchange.&nbsp; In Brazil it happens in cities such as S&atilde;o Paulo, Curitiba, Porto Alegre e Belo Horizonte.<br />
In Rio, PechaKucha Night is inspired by Brian Eno and Arthur C. Clark to define the theme Tecnomacumba against the Ex&uacute; of Ignorance bringing together 15 innovative minds to discuss digital culture.&nbsp; According to the collective Gambiarra, organizer of the event: &ldquo;These are people who do not believe when they are told that something is impossible and venture beyond the limits of what seems possible.&nbsp; Their methods are not different from that of magic.&nbsp; Their relationship with digital culture, be it t-hrough social empowerment, to promote new forms of expression, to improve and deliver new forms of education, is part of our universe of technological fathers and mothers-of-saint.&nbsp; Brian Eno once said in an interview on Wired magazine in 1996 that there was not enough Africa in our computers.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s bring people who show that our computers have a lot of Africa in them!&rdquo;<br />

<span style=""font-size:11px;"">In the 1920s, the urban theory of Ludwig Hilberseimer (1885&ndash;1967) redefined architecture&rsquo;s relationship to the city. His proposal for a high-rise city, where leisure, labor and circulation would be vertically integrated, both frightened his contemporaries and offered a trenchant critique of the dynamics of the capitalist metropolis. Hilberseimer&rsquo;s Groszstadtarchitektur (Metropolisarchitecture) is presented here for the first time in English translation. Two additional essays frame this international cross-section of metropolitan architecture: &ldquo;Der Wille zur Architektur&rdquo; (The Will to Architecture) and &ldquo;Vorschlag zur City-Bebauung&rdquo; (Proposal for City-Building). The propositions assembled here encourage us to reconsider mobility, concentration and the scale of architectural intervention in our own era of urban expansion.

Edward Durell Stone: American Modernist by Hicks Stone,Thursday,15,November,2012,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"<strong>Edward Durell Stone</strong>&nbsp;was one of the first American architects to experiment with&nbsp;European modernism in the early 1930s in a series of prominent homes in the&nbsp;Northeast and in his design for the Museum of Modern Art. &nbsp;However, Stone later&nbsp;rejected the austerity of International Style modernism at the apex of its&nbsp;popularity, in favor of a warmer architecture rooted in the American architectural tradition.<br />
Stone initially embraced&nbsp;<strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong>&lsquo;s aesthetic in the immediate postwar&nbsp;era, but later turned to classical precedent in his projects of the mid-1950s like the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India and the U.S. Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World&rsquo;s Fair. &nbsp;Stone&rsquo;s aesthetic choices engendered critical hostility among architectural&nbsp;cognoscenti, most notably in his later proto-post modernist work of the 1960s like the Huntington Hartford Museum of Modern Art in New York City, but at the same time generated enormous popular success.<br />
In this slide lecture, Stone&rsquo;s youngest son and biographer,&nbsp;<strong>Hicks Stone</strong>, himself a practicing architect, documents the breadth of his father&rsquo;s life and career. &nbsp;The lecture coincides with the debut of his book,&nbsp;<em>Edward Durell Stone: A Son&rsquo;s Untold Story of a Legendary Architect</em>, which is published by Rizzoli.<br />

Damage: No Longer Art: Salvage Art Institute,Wednesday,14,November,2012,[object Object],Core Series,"<em><strong>No Longer Art: Salvage Art Institute</strong></em><br />
<br />
Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation and the Arthur Ross Architecture Gallery present No Longer Art: Salvage Art Institute. Salvage art, a term borrowed from the art insurance lexicon, refers to work removed from art circulation due to accidental damage. Founded by artist Elka Krajewska, the Salvage Art Institute provides a refuge for salvaged artwork while offering a platform for confronting the regulation of its financial, aesthetic and social value.<br />
<br />
At the core of the exhibition is the first salvage art inventory gifted to the institute, a group of objects related primarily through their &ldquo;total loss&rdquo; status. Developed by Krajewska and GSAPP Exhibitions with the participation of AXA Art Insurance Corporation, No Longer Art: Salvage Art Institute engages an actuarial logic that delivers a series of curious reversals. Foremost among these is the annulment of the value of total loss objects. Once a work has been declared a total loss and indemnification has been paid, insured objects are officially considered devoid of value. Left in the limbo of warehouse storage, these objects belong to an odd nether world, no longer alive in terms of the market, gallery or museum system, but often still relatively intact. The survival of salvage art even past its total devaluation confronts our common understanding of where art ends, disturbing the distinction, organization, and separation of art from non-art.<br />
<br />
<strong>Elka Krajewska</strong><br />
Born in Warsaw and based in New York City, Elka Krajewska is the president<br />
and founder of Salvage Art Institute and an artist who works with film, sculpture, music and mixed media. Krajewska&#39;s work utilizes elements of her biography, contemporary interdisciplinary art historical strategies and is often based on collaboration.<br />

Unfinished Spaces,Tuesday,13,November,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"&ldquo;Cuba will count as having the most beautiful academy of arts in the world.&rdquo; -&nbsp;Fidel Castro (1961)<br />
<br />
  Cuba&#39;s ambitious National Art Schools project, designed by three young artists in the wake of Castro&#39;s Revolution, is neglected, nearly forgotten, then ultimately redis-covered as a visionary architectural masterpiece.  <br />
In 1961, three young, visionary architects were commissioned by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara to create Cuba&#39;s National Art Schools on the grounds of a former golf course in Havana, Cuba. Construction of their radical designs began immediately and the school&#39;s first classes soon followed. Dancers, musicians and artists from all over the country reveled in the beauty of the schools, but as the dream of the Revo-lution quickly became a reality, construction was abruptly halted and the architects and their designs were deemed irrelevant in the prevailing political climate.<br />
Forty years later the schools are in use, but remain unfinished and decaying. Castro has invited the exiled architects back to finish their unrealized dream.   Unfinished Spaces features intimate footage of Fidel Castro, showing his devotion to creating a worldwide showcase for art, and it also documents the struggle and passion of three revolutionary artists.  ",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

<br />
<u>Statement:</u><br />
<br />
&quot;Modernity, Architecture and Urban Life in the Arab Region&quot; is the first step towards a long-term endeavor aiming at constructing a regional platform bringing together scholars and practitioners from various fields investigating the notion of Modernity in the past, present and future of cities in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
This regional platform will address the meaning and essence of Modernity as a major project of cultural change encompassing ideological, territorial and socio-economic transformation affecting cities and their respective societies.<br />
<br />
Introducing &quot;Questions of Modernity&quot;, Timothy Mitchell explains the tension between the universal singular modernity and the pluralistic discourse of alternative modernities. If the modern is portrayed as a universal global phenomenon expanding with Western imperialism, then it is inevitably measured according to its manifestation within contexts outside of the West and according to the latter&#39;s contribution to the singular history of the modern. Similarly, the discourse of alternative modernities implies a singular modernity that is &quot;modified by local circumstances into a multiplicity of &#39;cultural&#39; forms.&quot; (Mitchell, Timothy ed., &quot;Questions of Modernity&quot;, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1999)<br />
<br />
Mitchell suggests acknowledging the singularity and universalism of modernity, yet at the same time noting that it is inevitably constituted, redirected and diverted by the alternative narratives that are systematically subordinated and marginalized:<br />
<br />
&quot;Each staging of the modern must be arranged to produce the global history of modernity, yet each requires those forms of difference that introduce the possibility of discrepancy, that return to undermine its unity and identity. Modernity becomes the unsuitable yet unavoidable name for these discrepant histories.&quot;<br />
<br />
How does modern architecture represent such differences and discrepancies in the context of the Arab city?<br />
<br />
Modernity Architecture and Urban Life will spark dialogue between different studies conducted on Modernity in Arab cities. A step towards a regional mapping of local narratives of modern architecture in the Middle East, it facilitates an understanding of the links and ruptures within the modern architectural and urban transformations of different Middle Eastern cities. How do architectural modern representations in cities such as Amman, Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca or Ramallah from the mid-20th century redefine the singular notion of Modernity? And how are such representations emerging today in contemporary architecture in Arab cities creating a stage for a new modern architectural language that is responsive to its social, economical and political context?<br />
<br />
This symposium will open in Ramallah on November 4th and will proceed in Amman on November 7th of 2012. Local, regional, and international contributors will shed light on alternative modernities emerging in various post-colonial contexts. More specifically, this event will bring together leading architecture historians, planners and designers who have dedicated their research to the multiplicity of quests for modernity through architectural representation from the mid-20th century until today, in cities such as Amman, Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Jerusalem, Nazareth and Ramallah.<br />

<u>Statement:</u><br />
<br />
&quot;Modernity, Architecture and Urban Life in the Arab Region&quot; is the first step towards a long-term endeavor aiming at constructing a regional platform bringing together scholars and practitioners from various fields investigating the notion of Modernity in the past, present and future of cities in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
This regional platform will address the meaning and essence of Modernity as a major project of cultural change encompassing ideological, territorial and socio-economic transformation affecting cities and their respective societies.<br />
<br />
Introducing &quot;Questions of Modernity&quot;, Timothy Mitchell explains the tension between the universal singular modernity and the pluralistic discourse of alternative modernities. If the modern is portrayed as a universal global phenomenon expanding with Western imperialism, then it is inevitably measured according to its manifestation within contexts outside of the West and according to the latter&#39;s contribution to the singular history of the modern. Similarly, the discourse of alternative modernities implies a singular modernity that is &quot;modified by local circumstances into a multiplicity of &#39;cultural&#39; forms.&quot; (Mitchell, Timothy ed., &quot;Questions of Modernity&quot;, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1999)<br />
<br />
Mitchell suggests acknowledging the singularity and universalism of modernity, yet at the same time noting that it is inevitably constituted, redirected and diverted by the alternative narratives that are systematically subordinated and marginalized:<br />
<br />
&quot;Each staging of the modern must be arranged to produce the global history of modernity, yet each requires those forms of difference that introduce the possibility of discrepancy, that return to undermine its unity and identity. Modernity becomes the unsuitable yet unavoidable name for these discrepant histories.&quot;<br />
<br />
How does modern architecture represent such differences and discrepancies in the context of the Arab city?<br />
<br />
Modernity Architecture and Urban Life will spark dialogue between different studies conducted on Modernity in Arab cities. A step towards a regional mapping of local narratives of modern architecture in the Middle East, it facilitates an understanding of the links and ruptures within the modern architectural and urban transformations of different Middle Eastern cities. How do architectural modern representations in cities such as Amman, Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca or Ramallah from the mid-20th century redefine the singular notion of Modernity? And how are such representations emerging today in contemporary architecture in Arab cities creating a stage for a new modern architectural language that is responsive to its social, economical and political context?<br />
<br />
This symposium will open in Ramallah on November 4th and will proceed in Amman on November 7th of 2012. Local, regional, and international contributors will shed light on alternative modernities emerging in various post-colonial contexts. More specifically, this event will bring together leading architecture historians, planners and designers who have dedicated their research to the multiplicity of quests for modernity through architectural representation from the mid-20th century until today, in cities such as Amman, Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Jerusalem, Nazareth and Ramallah.<br />

ABOUT SUBHENDU DASGUPTA<br />
Subhendu is a former faculty member of the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of Calcutta. He has also served as Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta and Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. An avid collector of cartoons, Subhendu received two grants from IFA to chronicle the evolution of cartoons in Bengal, and publish a book about his findings. Through his research he has collected and studied over a thousand cartoon strips published in Bengal between 1874 and 2009, painstakingly gathered from libraries in West Bengal and Dhaka from more than 45 newspapers, periodicals and special issue journals. Cartoons as a form of creative expression have been given only passing attention in Indian art discourse and Indian historiography, which is what, make s Subhendu&rsquo;s work so critical.<br />

CANCELLED: Rethinking a Lot,Tuesday,30,October,2012,LiPS,LiPS,"There are an estimated 600,000,000 passenger cars in the world, and all of them need parking. Because of that Earth&rsquo;s supply of parking spaces is steadily increasing. In some American cities, parking lots cover more than one-third of the land area. Stadium and mall parking stretches over acres of asphalt. It&rsquo;s official: We have paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Most of us regard the parking lot as a necessary evil, needed to accommodate our personal transportation preference for driving around in cars (and then having to put them somewhere). But, could parking lots be aesthetically pleasing? Environmentally and architecturally responsible? Used for something other than car storage?<br />
<br />
In his talk, Eran Ben-Joseph will provide a generously illustrated history of parking lots and will show some of the many and varied nonparking purposes they already serve. With purposeful design, he will argue, parking lots could be significant public places, contributing as much to their communities as great boulevards, parks, or plazas. For all the acreage they cover, parking lots have received scant attention. It&rsquo;s time to rethink the lot.",New York,"Room 114, Avery Hall"

Design after Decline,Tuesday,16,October,2012,LiPS,LiPS,"Almost fifty years ago, America&#39;s industrial cities began shedding people and jobs, and the future of neighborhoods in these places is precarious. How we will rebuild shrinking cities and what urban design vision will guide their future remain contentious and unknown. In Design After Decline, Brent D. Ryan reveals the fraught and intermittently successful efforts of architects, planners, and city officials to rebuild shrinking cities following mid-century urban renewal.<br />
<br />
In twin narratives, Ryan describes how America&#39;s two largest shrinking cities, Detroit and Philadelphia, faced the challenge of design after decline in dramatically different ways. Philadelphia emulated its own best policy and design practices from 1960s urban renewal with salutary results, while Detroit permitted the market to construct self-enclosed suburban enclaves. Today, shrinking cities face a new wave of abandonment and new opportunities for reimagining their urban fabrics. Ryan proposes that the unprecedented crisis facing these cities requires a revival of the visionary thinking found in the best modernist urban design, tempered with the lessons gained from post-1960s community planning and a spirit of optimism, to shape a brighter future for shrinking cities and their residents.<br />
<br />
Brent D. Ryan is Assistant Professor of Urban Design and Public Policy in MIT&rsquo;s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. His research focuses on emerging urban design paradigms, particularly in postindustrial cities. His book Design After Decline: How America rebuilds shrinking cities, was published in 2012. He has worked as an urban designer in New York City, Boston, and Chicago, and previously taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he was also Co-Director of the City Design Center. Ryan holds degrees from Yale University (1991), Columbia University (1994), and MIT (2002).",New York,"Room 114, Avery Hall"

Move: Theatrum Mundi / Global Street,Friday,12,October,2012,Core Series,Core Series,"<strong>Presence and Absence in the City</strong><br />
October 12&ndash;13<br />
The overall theme turns on the difference between absence and presence in the city. This difference lies both physically&mdash;who is actually on the street?; and perceptually&mdash;how are people aware of others, accounting or discounting their presence in urban space? How are those considered invisible or inconsequential enabled to &lsquo;make presence&rsquo; in urban space&mdash;through their bodies, actions, activities. We want to account the roles of technological, trade, design, and politics in constructing presence and absence; finally, we want to pose questions about how to arouse people to want more engagement with one another, rather than retreat into isolation.<br />

This session focuses simply on what makes a street alive or dead: the &#39;life of the street&#39; is a classic Jane Jacobs trope; what does it mean today? Have the people who once gave streets life left the city, or been removed, or ceased to wish to interact? Has the design of streets prevented people from engaging with one another? One additional key issue is the privatizing of public space.<br />

Atelier Ashley Munday,Thursday,11,October,2012,Lecture,Studio-X,"As architects and urban designers we always find ourselves working around the globe in a diverse range of countries and communities other than our own.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the sense of both where we all live and where we do projects we are all constant foreigners at any point in time. The notion of being constant foreigners in perhaps the worlds&rsquo; most culturally diverse city of London keeps us fresh and constantly inquisitive about our surroundings and the people we come across and in this sense it creates a frame of mind within the practice that we always need to absorb and understand the places within which we work. We feel sometimes that we are &lsquo;architectural backpackers&rsquo; with a responsibility to understand the inherent culture of the places we go but to also bring the fresh understanding and inquisitive mind of a foreigner to identify what is special and inherent to a place.<br />
<br />
We approach our projects firstly as a kind of urban anthropologist and archeologist where it is about research, observation and understanding of not only the physical aspects of the place where we are working but the aspects of the culture, people and history that are important. We are not only deeply interested in but see it as our responsibility to understand and work with the what the Romans called &lsquo;genius loci&rsquo; or &lsquo;sense of place&rsquo; and by doing so we produce buildings and cityscapes of cultural relevance that are contemporary and forward looking but also have their origins rooted in the past.<br />
<br />
While we have to acknowledge that we are almost always foreigners and rarely locals and that we can never begin to understand everything about the people and places in which we find ourselves we deliberately seek out collaborators who can inform our work and understanding of each unique environment. Our task in many ways begins as purely about the art of observation and absorption and we often have to look beyond the world of design professionals as advisors where writers, poets and artists and even shopkeepers, farmers and chefs often have the most acute powers of observation and connection with their surroundings.<br />
<br />
While understanding the local context is important it is also often and advantage to be a foreigner and this puts us in a unique position to help identify what is special about a place or city.",Mumbai,Studio-X Mumbai
ART + POWER + SPACE,Thursday,11,October,2012,Roundtable Discussion,Studio-X,"Reports about the arts in the Arab region assert a &lsquo;booming&rsquo; state of affairs. Ambitious plans for art museums in the Gulf, new faculties of art and design, the influence of diaspora artists, and an unprecedented increase in artists&rsquo; residencies created opportunities and exposure for Arab artists internationally and for international artists to work in the region. The Arab region&rsquo;s hierarchical relationship to the global network has stealthily been forming through the burgeoning market for Middle Eastern and Contemporary Arab Art. Yet the effect of the market on informing or misinforming knowledge of the art production of the region &ndash; particularly in view of the absence of a scholarly discourse &ndash; is problematic and alarming.<br />
<br />
The Arab world with its socio-political tensions and contradictions provides a rich laboratory of young Arab artists, who are looking for answers to the ever more complex trajectories of (Post)Modernity than one might find at the major auction houses. While an expansive cultural art territory forms the new links between the local topology and the global network extending from important galleries and institutions in Beirut like the Ayyam Gallery and the Beirut Art Center through Amman&rsquo;s Darat Al Funun and Makan House to the Guggenheim and the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, what is new in Contemporary Arab Art is not just the mediums being deployed. Rather it is the image in all its forms that Arab artists have subverted while creating spaces for the interpretation and engagement with the arts.<br />
<br />
If Architecture is a form of knowledge and the materialization of concept, then how does Architecture materialize in an emergent &lsquo;space of flows&rsquo; &ndash; the spatial logic that does not upend the city but rather provides a reflexive lens by which to critique the flows of information, capital, markets, technology, interaction, flows of images, sounds, and symbols as well as power structures and political systems embedded in urban morphologies? What is the conceptual ground for Architecture where identity and image seek to be subverted by Arab artists while creating new spaces for the production, criticism and consumption of Contemporary Arab Art?",Amman,"Darat Al Funun, Amman"

&ldquo;We have to start from scratch,&rdquo; contends Kengo Kuma.

Kuma advocates for minimizing by designing modest, self-powered interventions that are made with local materials. &quot;The whole world is shifting toward small things.

Imagine small, intricate structures hanging outside your window that efficiently harvest enough night moisture to water your herb garden. Or an array of tiny limbs attached to a tall building that capture moisture from the night sky and distribute it to a potable water reservoir. Through close examination of how plants photosynthesize, capture moisture, and pollinate, a new wave of architectural structures will emerge. This workshop will look closely at plants collected from within New York City and will use the physiologic systems of the plants to inform form, material, and behavior of architecture.<br />

Community Benefits Agreements,Tuesday,9,October,2012,LiPS,LiPS,"Community benefits agreements (CBAs) are legally binding contracts between community-based organizations and private developers, setting out a slate of community benefits to be delivered through large urban development projects. The rise of CBAs is indicative of, and to some extent has driven, a transformation of attitudes of low-income communities towards development projects, from a purely defensive posture to one that embraces the opportunities these projects can provide. In the ten years since the emergence of CBAs, this movement has permanently changed the dialogue and substance of negotiations over large urban development projects across the country. California attorney Julian Gross has represented community groups in successful negotiation of over a dozen CBAs, including several prominent agreements that have received extensive academic attention. This lecture will elucidate aspects of successful CBAs, address recurring criticisms of and concerns with CBAs, and discuss appropriate public and private roles in land use planning for complex, controversial projects. &nbsp;Many of these issues will be illuminated through examination of the challenging CBA experience in New York City and the more-successful approach seen in California.<br />

<br />
This tour and symposium continue the work of the Dredge Research Collaborative, who originally joined us in January 2012 for a Live Interview at Studio-X NYC (LI@SX) on the techniques of dredging, and the galaxy of technologies that surround it. As the DRC notes, dredge &quot;constitutes perhaps the greatest unrecognized landscape architecture project in the world. Dredge shapes our beaches and waterways, it is driven by what we do to distant upstream forests and fields, it plays a key role in global shipping networks, and in coastal real estate.&quot;<br />

Out of Focus: When Photographic Archives Disappear,Thursday,27,September,2012,Inquiry:HP,Inquiry:HP,"This lecture by author and architect&nbsp;<strong>Pierluigi Serraino</strong>&nbsp;will&nbsp;address the gaps of knowledge and representation in the architectural discourse of modern architecture when photographic archives are either lost, unprocessed or in private hands, inaccessible for scholarly appraisal. &nbsp;Two case studies will be presented to demonstrate the correlation and causation between visibility of archival resources and identity formation in the construction of the architectural canon. &nbsp;While architectural photography is central in the delivery of this argument, additional emphasis will be given to the function of the archive itself in shaping our current knowledge of the culture and outcome of modern architecture. &nbsp;A third and final case study will highlight the extent of this phenomenon.",New York,Buell 200

You can even wear the <a href=""http://usa.thescentofdeparture.com/destinations.php"">smell of New York City</a> if you want to! Does the big apple smell fragrant to you or is it rotten to the core?<br />
<br />
Join us for a guided smellwalk and talk led by <a href=""http://manchester.academia.edu/VHenshaw"">Dr. Victoria Henshaw</a>, a researcher in architecture and urbanism at the University of Manchester, England. Her work on <a href=""http://smellandthecity.wordpress.com/"">smell and the city</a> examines the role of smell in urban experience, perception and design. As we smell our way through lower Manhattan, Henshaw will discuss characteristic urban smells, how smell relates to place perception, and <a href=""http://www.ediblegeography.com/smell-designing-sheffield/"">what issues architects and urban designers need to consider</a> when thinking about smell in their work.<br />

Park(ing) day 2012,Friday,21,September,2012,Performance,Studio-X,"Rio de Janeiro, September 21, 2012 - Today, in many cities around the world, artists, activists and citizens are turning parking spaces into temporary public parks and other social interaction environments, as part of the annual event called PARK (ing) Day.<br />
<br />
For the second consecutive year the Studio-X Rio, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP Brazil) and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (FAU / UFRJ) is supporting a group of architects, designers and other citizens with questions about &quot;what would you do with a wave of car.&quot; The answer is to occupy a place in Pra&ccedil;a Tiradentes, 48, with a program of cinema that begins at 17:00 pm, followed by a party.<br />
<br />
Since 2005, the project has turned into a popular movement worldwide: PARK (ing) Day 2011 included more than 975 installations in over 160 cities on six continents.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Park (ing) Day is a great opportunity to discuss with citizens about the purpose of public space. Instead of parking for cars, we could have more democratic spaces such as cafes, bike paths, sidewalks and parks,&quot; says the CEO of ITDP, Walter Hook. &quot;Whereas every car journey begins and ends in a parking space, the management of this area is the Achilles heel of highly motorized cities.&quot;<br />
<br />
In Rio de Janeiro, the PARK (ing) Day is being organized by Adriana Sans&atilde;o, Carol Souza, Cesar Jordan, Dennis Fl&ocirc;r, Fernando Esposito, Pedro Evora, with the support of Studio-X Rio, the ITDP Brazil, FAU / UFRJ and Rio de Janeiro Transportation Department.",Rio De Janeiro,Studio-X Rio

Leading Urban Revitalization Strategist and MacArthur Fellow Majora Carter discusses the potentials of gentrification&mdash;like forces of wind, solar, and fire&mdash;to be harnessed for public good. In particular, how to &ldquo;create the economic diversity in poor communities that encourages more successful people to stay, poor people to have more hope, and newcomers to feel great about what they are contributing to,&rdquo; in relation to a proposed transformation of the Bridges Juvenile Center in the Spofford Avenue Neighborhood of the South Bronx. &ldquo;Concentrated poverty diminishes hope and possibility for those who can&#39;t escape,&rdquo; Carter notes. &ldquo;How do we harness the power of gentrification to create better communities with more potential for everyone?&rdquo;<br />

54 minutes<br />

Colonnade Park takes Mies van der Rohe&#39;s Colonnade and Pavilion apartment buildings in Newark, New Jersey as point of departure to consider how the social fabric of the site has been shaped over time by this architecture. Built between 1954 and 1960, the Colonnade and Pavilion Apartments&mdash;three glass-and-steel towers&mdash;and the Christopher Columbus Homes, a public housing project, marked the beginning of urban renewal in Newark. Holzfeind&#39;s conversations with tenants about their experiences living in these classic modernist buildings patch together a snap shot of contemporary life while unearthing historical narratives.<br />

Between&nbsp; December 2010 to February 2011 Christoph Draeger and Heidrun Holzfeind traveled to the five countries most affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami&ndash;Thailand, Aceh/Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives and India&ndash;to look at the current state of architecture built or reconstructed in the aftermath of the disaster. Documenting long-term effects through conversations with survivors, eyewitnesses, aid workers and rescue personnel, Draeger and Holzfeind also established a collection of footage of the disaster and the reconstruction efforts. The work looks at how aid money transformed affected regions, rebuilt and refashioned local economies while asking how these structures have adapted over time by inhabitants.<br />

Learning from Indianapolis,Tuesday,18,September,2012,Lecture,[object Object],"Tim Carter and Bill Taft will be sharing some of Indianapolis&#39; recent efforts to strengthen its existing resources in policy, community, ecology and economy.<br />
<br />
Dr. Carter will focus on two ecological domains - water and land - discussing how a place with relatively little in the way of major natural assets (no mountains, ocean, big lake, topography etc) relates to its physical context. On Water - recent initiatives attempting to reconnect people to the city&rsquo;s major waterways, reflecting on broader livability goals; on Land - urban agriculture and recent research of food deserts and vacant lots as means of serving ecological and social goods.<br />
<br />
Mr. Taft will discuss the city&rsquo;s efforts in creating a policy and resource framework meant to reposition the urban core neighborhoods as competitive places to live, work, invest, recreate and be educated. This effort is designed to enable the city to transform places of concentrated need into unique assets that compete with the surrounding communities, through supporting neighborhood stakeholders in the creation and implementation of their own unique quality of life plans.<br />
<br />
The following discussion will explore questions of the relationship between urban core and periphery, what builds a city&#39;s competitive advantage, and how or whether cities can learn these skills from each other.<br />

More people have been displaced since Independence by development projects than by the partition and a majority of them have been indigenous adivasis or Dalits.<br />
Landless Dalits who would migrate to Mumbai after Independence would eventually face bulldozers and the fate of every slum: demolition.<br />
Across the country, there are numerous islands of resistance for the protection of one&rsquo;s land against displacement by development, and land alienation. Yet all these movements face state repression in the form of police firings, false cases, and the state policies of divide and rule.<br />

Devices of Perception,Friday,17,August,2012,Workshop,Studio-X,"The method in which we record our environments has both shaped the perception of the world and often altered reality itself. In this way, since the invention of perspective, the way we look at the world has also been the way we make the world. There must be both the need and the invention of new methods of perception which can capture this transformation.<br />
<br />
This workshop is a short and intense research project on innovative methods and tools that will document the transformation of our urban environments. The resulting devices will be the permanent collection of the first Virtual Museum of Architecture in China.<br />

A Journey Into the Meadowlands with Matthew Coolidge ,Saturday,11,August,2012,Tour,Studio-X,"Join Matthew Coolidge, director of the Center for Land Use Interpretation, on a slideshow safari into the industrial swamps of the Meadowlands. This presentation is the culmination of a few years of the Center&rsquo;s research into this dramatic American landscape, a superlative antipode to the great urban spaces that surround it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The New Jersey Meadowlands are a network of tidal wetlands located roughly between the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers in Northeast New Jersey. One of the largest blocks of open space in the New York metropolitan area, the Meadowlands are also home to a curious collection of abandoned mega-malls, fragrance and flavoring factories, Superfund sites, endangered bird habitats, radio towers, and the ruins of Penn Station.<br />
<br />
The <a href=""http://www.clui.org/"">Center for Land Use Interpretation</a> (CLUI) is a research and education organization focusing on human use and perception of the landscape. Headquartered in Los Angeles, its recent projects include investigations and exhibitions on <a href=""http://www.clui.org/section/perpetual-architecture-uranium-disposal-cells-america"">uranium disposal cells</a>, the <a href=""http://clui.org/page/texas-oil-landscape-industry"">Texan oilscape</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.clui.org/section/initial-points-anchors-america%E2%80%99s-grid"">historic surveying infrastructure of the United States</a>.<br />

"Lunar Architecture: P.S. hab cool, moon desolate, miner lonely",Friday,10,August,2012,interactive talks,Studio-X,"Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend some time on the Moon! Getting there isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal; landing though might me and staying would be quite an ordeal. The excitement and hardships of living on our home planet&rsquo;s nearest neighbor are still anybody&rsquo;s guess.<br />
<br />
Imagine unwinding at the end of an exhausting day of fieldwork with a glass of martini and watching the earthrise! It will be a mesmerizing, transformational, out-of-this-world experience. The tough part will be coping with moon dust and surviving radiation, not to mention the black-white-gray color palette that will gnaw away at the psyche of any long-term inhabitant.<br />
<br />
Design, fabrication, transportation, deployment, piecemeal construction, add-on architecture, maintenance, repair and renewal of surface habitation and transportation systems on the moon will be a huge challenge. This interactive talk with (outer) space architect <strong>Susmita Mohanty</strong> will introduce the audience to myriad aspects of life on the Moon &ndash; the good, the bad, the ugly and the utterly romantic.<br />

X-Total,Saturday,4,August,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"The digital fabrication workshop sponsored by Studio-X Rio, in partnership with Columbia University and the PUC-Rio, proposes a new look at one of the most interesting and yet overlooked elements of culture and daily life in Rio: the wagon, cart, wagon, the donkey without a tail.<br />
<br />
Used as carriers of cargo these carts around the center of Rio have a key role in day-to-day city. In constant evolution, they are tailored to the needs of its users by turning into the place of sale of products, mobile sound, temporary housing, etc.. and somehow become an extension of the body and life of their drivers, inseparable elements of their work and their relationship with the city. The potential of these stands are not limited pragmatic functions of transport and trade, the carts also has a cultural role, hybrid and ephemeral, capable of activating the city&#39;s public spaces of the most unusual and creative.<br />
<br />
With that thought the Studio-X Rio invited the Digital Fabrication Laboratory, Faculty of Architecture at Columbia University (GSAPP) and CAU PUC-Rio to develop the workshop with students from two institutions aiming to design and build three carriages to be used for cultural events, in Tiradentes Square.<br />
<br />
The students used a combination of digital and hand tools and had the partnership of the Arts and Crafts company that donated the use of a router and laser cutter to produce the various parts of the project, assembled by hand by the students. The colors and textures of the carts are reflections of the materials used, all recycled and locally sourced. As the cars target a positive impact on the city, the choice of materials and construction methods seek to avoid a negative impact on the environment.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
O workshop de fabrica&ccedil;&atilde;o digital promovido pelo Studio-X Rio, em parceria com a Columbia University e a PUC-Rio, prop&otilde;e um novo olhar sobre um dos mais interessantes e ao mesmo tempo despercebidos elementos da cultura e do dia a dia do carioca: a carro&ccedil;a, carrinho, carrocinha, o burro sem rabo.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Utilizados como ve&iacute;culos de transporte de cargas esses carrinhos espalhados pelo Centro do Rio possuem um papel fundamental no dia-a-dia da cidade. Em constante evolu&ccedil;&atilde;o eles s&atilde;o adaptados &agrave;s necessidades de seus usuarios se transformando em local de venda de produtos, som m&oacute;vel, moradia tempor&aacute;ria, etc. e de certa forma se tornam uma extens&atilde;o do corpo e da vida dos seus condutores, elementos indissoci&aacute;veis do seu trabalho e da sua rela&ccedil;&atilde;o com a cidade.&nbsp; As potencialidades desses carrinhos n&atilde;o se limitam as fun&ccedil;&otilde;es pragm&aacute;ticas de transporte e com&eacute;rcio, as carro&ccedil;as tem tamb&eacute;m um papel cultural, h&iacute;brido e ef&ecirc;mero, capazes de ativar os espa&ccedil;os p&uacute;blicos da cidade das formas mais inusitadas e criativas.<br />
<br />
Com esse pensamento o Studio-X Rio convidou o Laborat&oacute;rio de Fabrica&ccedil;&atilde;o Digital da Faculdade de Arquitetura da Columbia University (GSAPP) e o CAU PUC-Rio para desenvolver o workshop com alunos das duas institui&ccedil;&otilde;es tendo como objetivo projetar e construir tr&ecirc;s carrinhos a serem utilizados, em eventos culturais, na Pra&ccedil;a Tiradentes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Os alunos utilizaram uma combina&ccedil;&atilde;o de ferramentas manuais e digitais e contaram com a parceria da empresa Artes e Of&iacute;cios que cedeu o uso de seu roteador e cortador a laser para a produ&ccedil;&atilde;o das diversas partes do projeto, montadas &agrave; m&atilde;o pelos alunos. As cores e texturas dos carrinhos s&atilde;o reflexos dos materiais utilizados, todos eles reciclados e de fontes locais. Assim como os carrinhos visam um impacto positivo na cidade, a escolha dos materiais e m&eacute;todos de constru&ccedil;&atilde;o buscam evitar um impacto negativo no meio ambiente.<br />

Presence: Public Space Workshop 2012,Friday,29,June,2012,Opening,Studio-X,"The Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) is holding its annual <strong>Public Space Workshop</strong> for architecture students in collaboration with the <strong>Columbia University Middle East Research Center</strong> in Amman, Jordan and the <strong>Columbia Global Center in Istanbul, Turkey</strong> from June 15th &ndash; June 29th, 2012.<br />
<br />
The Public Space Workshop is an intensive two-week rapid exchange in search of emergent issues concerning contemporary public space.&nbsp; Students and faculty from participating universities collaborate at nodes within GSAPP&#39;s Studio-X Global Network to investigate design issues, expanding their understanding through a diverse array of feedback.&nbsp; The cities are active testing grounds for research and experimentation within the built environment.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Public space is the interface for exchanges in cities, and today more than ever the site of rapid change.&nbsp; The physical presence of public space continues to grow more dynamic as the use of complementary virtual networks provide for increased access and mobility.&nbsp; Together, they form an adaptive infrastructure in cities, emerging, networking, and responding in unprecedented ways.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 2012 session of the workshop focuses on Presence.&nbsp; As an essential agent for change, Presence requires public participation and exchange in the activation and networking of public space.&nbsp; The users of these augmented spaces continuously reshape them, exposing new potentials in the city, as they forecast, map, and interact in a smart way. Presence emerges at the impermanent intersection of physical and virtual public spaces.<br />

The High Line,Wednesday,27,June,2012,Discussion,Studio-X,"Initially seen as &quot;a crazy project that probably would not succeed,&quot; the High Line is now one of the most beloved urban amenities of New York, attracting more than 4 million visitors since its opening in 2009. Since the city reused the High Line as a public park, more than $2 billion was invested in real estate development, architectural projects including three winners of the Pritzker Prize. The adjacent neighborhoods Meatpacking District and West Chelsea are now the most desirable business addresses in the city for creative industries.<br />
<br />
The presentation will explore the history of the High Line, a visionary effort to preserve it, and the extraordinary impact that this park has had on real estate, architecture and the city around it.<br />

Favela Exchange,Tuesday,26,June,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"The favelas of Rio de Janeiro represent the dual nature of the transformation of contemporary urban conditions. Changing the perspective of an urban marginalized, excluded, an important factor for social cohesion and economic growth, the favela has the potential to be considered as a new paradigm for a sustainable urban future. High population density, busy streets, micro-entrepreneurial activities and functions are typical examples of the multipurpose cities informal approaches can be incorporated into government planning.<br />
<br />
ETH opened an investigation into the transformative potential of informal environments at various levels. The research conducted by <strong>Prof. Christian Kerez</strong> is focused on the morphology of the slums, unveiling the spatial manifestation of informal settlements. Under the title Mobilize Brazil the masters and bachelor lected by teachers <strong>Hubert Klumpner</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Alfredo Brillembourg</strong> investigate the integrated mobility favoring new proposals with an inclusive vision of the city. Under the direction of <strong>Rainer Hehl</strong> the Master&#39;s program for Advanced Studies in Urban Design (Urban Design MAS) has selected Brazil as the main target since 2010. In their recent studies program MAS UD is studying the City of God, where formal housing settlements became informally in densified urban structures, forming a new sub-urban center. The Professor. <strong>Annette Spiro</strong> with <strong>Udo Thoenissen</strong> is dedicated to establishing an official exchange program between the Faculty of Architecture of Sao Paulo (FAU-USP) and the Department of Architecture of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich D-ARCH).<br />
<br />
What are the lessons from case studies in Brazil? Rather than impose a foreign territory as specific to the Brazilian city, the initiative of ETH has the support of institutions and agencies in Brazil, using the Brazilian context as a territory-test and an urban laboratory of sustainable models for the city of tomorrow.<br />

Mudando a perspectiva de um ambiente urbano marginalizado, exclu&iacute;do, para um importante fator de coes&atilde;o social e crescimento econ&ocirc;mico, a favela tem o potencial de ser considerada como o novo paradigma para um futuro urbano sustent&aacute;vel. Alta densidade populacional, ruas movimentadas, atividades micro-empreendedoras e fun&ccedil;&otilde;es multiuso s&atilde;o caracter&iacute;sticas exemplares das cidades informais que podem ser incorporadas &agrave;s abordagens de planejamento governamental.<br />
<br />
A ETH iniciou uma investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o sobre o potencial transformador dos ambientes informais em v&aacute;rios n&iacute;veis. A pesquisa conduzida pelo <strong>Prof. Christian Kerez</strong> &eacute; voltada para a morfologia das favelas, desvendando a manifesta&ccedil;&atilde;o espacial das ocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es informais. Sob o titulo Mobilize Brazil os cursos de mestrado e bacharelado lecionados pelos professores <strong>Hubert Klumpner</strong> e <strong>Alfredo Brillembourg</strong> investigam o sistema integrado de mobilidade favorecendo novas propostas com uma vis&atilde;o inclusiva da cidade. Sob a dire&ccedil;&atilde;o de <strong>Rainer Hehl</strong> o programa de Mestrado de Estudos Avan&ccedil;ados em Desenho Urbano (MAS Urban Design) selecionou o Brasil como alvo principal desde 2010. Em seus estudos recentes o programa MAS UD est&aacute; estudando a Cidade de Deus, onde assentamentos formais de habita&ccedil;&atilde;o popular transformaram-se informalmente em estruturas urbanas densificadas, formando um novo sub-centro urbano. A Profa. <strong>Annette Spiro</strong> com <strong>Udo Thoenissen</strong> se dedica a estabelecer um programa de interc&acirc;mbio oficial entre a Faculdade de Arquitetura de S&atilde;o Paulo (FAU-USP) e o Departamento de Arquitetura do Instituto Federal Su&iacute;&ccedil;o de Tecnologia Zurique (D-ARCH ETH Z&uuml;rich).<br />

Supernova,Thursday,21,June,2012,Exhibition,Studio-X,"The action of the graphite occurs in existing urban contexts, such as activating surfaces in the most neglected and forgotten by time, and acting on a previously established spatial geometry. But what if both geometry and graphite could appear simultaneously, influencing each other during the process of creation?<br />
<br />
The installation SUPERNOVA arises from the dynamic between geometry and graphite, increasing territory completely new to the team of employees involved. By means of manual and parametric creation, analog and digital design is the aim of reaching new imaginary space collaboratively and synergistically. During the four days of the 3rd Digital Circus Festival, SUPERNOVA serve as a platform for such research.<br />
<br />
SUPERNOVA is part of an ongoing project between the collective FAISCAS, whose mission is to enable collaborative intersections between art and architecture in Rio de Janeiro, and the carioca artist Smael, internationally recognized for his work born of the imagination of urban Rio.<br />

Pockets of Strength<br />
Midtown south, Hudson Square, the Plaza district and DUMBO are all performing well as the city&rsquo;s economy takes a turn towards more creative and tech-driven firms. Meanwhile, new hotels are sprouting all over town, the city&rsquo;s academic institutions are building up a storm, and preparations are underway for a new tech campus. So who is driving all this activity, how sustainable will it be, and how does it compare with past periods in terms of location to pricing and everything in between.<br />

<br />
The New Money Trail<br />
The people who are really making the calls on what gets built in New York City are the financiers. With the mortgage-backed securities market still dead in the water, banks and insurers hold the purse strings. What does it take to succeed in the new real estate ecosystem?<br />
<br />
Panelists:<br />
Nicholas Bienstock, Managing Partner, Savanna<br />
Alicia Glen, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group<br />
Scott Rechler, Chairman &amp; CEO, RXR Realty LLC<br />
Jeffrey Temple, Partner, Morrison Foerster<br />
<br />
Over the Horizon<br />
Should owners of Manhattan&rsquo;s over-60 crowd rehab and green their aging buildings, or should they tear them down and start again? It&rsquo;s generally far cheaper to renovate than rip down and rebuild, but there can also be a long term cost to the city if it hangs on to its old stock. What should landlords do with their Manhattan properties of that vintage?<br />

Panelists:<br />
David W. Levinson, Chairman &amp; CEO, L&amp;L Holding Company, LLC<br />
Anthony Malkin, President, Malkin Securities<br />
Michael Phillips, COO, JAMESTOWN<br />
Robert Tierney, NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, Chairman<br />
<br />
The Residential Puzzle<br />
<br />
Today&rsquo;s market is a post-boom classic: Much of the development we&rsquo;ve seen has been of affordable housing while the rental market is going great guns as more people shun ownership for fear the market has further to fall. But now there are signs the balance could be tilting again. A surprising number of very high-end condo developments have started up and in some cases begun to sell out. Meanwhile, rising rents threaten to shift the affordability equation back in favor of ownership.<br />

"""There's No One There"" Exhibition Opening",Wednesday,23,May,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"Free and open to the public; no RSVP necessary.<br />
<br />
Join Studio-X NYC to celebrate the release of <em>Man-Made Lands</em>, a collection of seven stories and five real architectural and landscape proposals for cities around the world, and the installation of a new series, entitled &quot;There&#39;s No One There,&quot; by Joe Alterio.<br />
<br />
If young architects are pitching a proposal for a floating public pool in the East River on Kickstarter, how might the influence of prose fiction change? If each year the Museum of Modern Art commissions architects to develop fictional solutions to real problems like climate change and foreclosure, can we look also to novelists also to read about how we&rsquo;ll live next?<br />
<br />
A shift occurred, without us noticing it. <em>Man-Made Lands</em> is a map of marbled boundaries: between cities and nature; between the infinity of the digital and the analog of every day life; between the past and our present, our present and many possible futures; between fictions we envision and the facts that we construct to transform lives. New conditions take Ninth Letter&rsquo;s mission of collaboration between literary artists and designers beyond the boundaries of the magazine toward new and unexpected alliances.<br />
<br />
To mark the release of <em>Man-Made Lands</em> and Ninth Letter&#39;s Spring/Summer 2012 issue, and celebrate the opening of &quot;There&#39;s No One There,&quot; Studio-X NYC will host an evening of drinks, easter eggs, and talk on Wednesday, May 23, at 7pm.

Megaprojects: An International Urban Planning and Development Conference,Friday,11,May,2012,Conference,CURE,"<b><a href=""http://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pe/9668220"" target=""_blank"">REGISTER HERE</a>.</b><br />
<strong>For more information, visit the <a href=""http://megaprojects2012.com/"" target=""_blank"">conference website</a>.</strong><br />
<br />
This one-day international conference will convene leading developers, architects, engineers and urban planners to explore megaprojects, both those constrained by the New York City street grid and those that were not. The Conference will address the issues faced and the lessons learned in developing and operating megaprojects in New York as well as in her sister city of London.<br />
<br />
Acclaimed as &ldquo;the single most important document in New York City&rsquo;s development&rdquo;, the New York City street grid celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2011. Since its adoption in 1811, the grid (originally known as the Commissioners&rsquo; Plan of 1811) has proved to be the single most powerful factor shaping the nature and shape of real estate development in the city.<br />
<br />
But over the last 50 years, a number of large real estate developments (&ldquo;megaprojects&rdquo;) have challenged the adequacy and the effectiveness of the grid as a tool for modern city planning. The development of the World Trade Center required the closure of centuries-old streets to assemble its contiguous 16-acre plot. More recently, Hudson Yards on Manhattan&rsquo;s west side has evolved as another mega-development to overlook the street grid that the Commissioners&rsquo; Plan envisioned for that site. It may soon be joined by yet another large development project proposed by Governor Cuomo &ndash; on the current site of the Javits Center.<br />
<br />
Yet over this same half century, major urban redevelopments have successfully occurred without violating the spirit or the practicalities of the Manhattan street grid. The resurgence of places like Times Square, Union Square or Columbus Circle as major office, residential and tourist destinations speak to the ability to reimagine the city even within the grid&rsquo;s rectilinear confines.<br />
<br />
Join us at a full-day exploration of megaprojects and how they will impact the future growth and development of our cities.",New York,McGraw-Hill Conference Center
"Reflections & Opportunities: Design, Cities, and the World Cup",Thursday,10,May,2012,[object Object],Studio-X,"Studio-X Rio e Centro Carioca de Design convidam para o lan&ccedil;amento do livro e palestra  <br />
<strong>REFLEX&Otilde;ES &amp;&nbsp; OPORTUNIDADES: DESIGN, CIDADES E COPA DO MUNDO </strong><br />
<br />
Editado por <strong>Zahira Asmal</strong><br />
Pref&aacute;cio por <strong>Dr. Danny Jordaan</strong><br />
<br />
A Copa do Mundo de 2010 proporcionou uma oportunidade de se reimaginar as cidades sul-africanas. O &iacute;mpeto e o investimento em infra-estrutura para o mega evento foram catalisadores para muitos projetos de espa&ccedil;o e transportes p&uacute;blicos, que procuravam tornar as cidades sul-africanas ambientes urbanos mais conectados, integrados, acess&iacute;veis e, portanto, mais democr&aacute;ticos.<br />
<br />
O design foi um componente central da Copa do Mundo. Uma ampla gama de profiss&otilde;es criativas, locais e internacionais, foi reunida para tornar o evento o sucesso que foi&nbsp; - arquitetos, designers gr&aacute;ficos, planejadores urbanos e redatores - todos foram essenciais. O mais importante, entretanto, foi que a capacidade para resolu&ccedil;&atilde;o de problemas centrais da &Aacute;frica do Sul foi ampliada durante a Copa do Mundo, e agora existe um acervo de profissionais de design experientes que s&atilde;o capazes de ajudar o pa&iacute;es e a outros no seu desenvolvimento futuro.<br />
<br />
Reflex&otilde;es &amp; Oportunidades: Design, Cidades e Copa do Mundo se dedica a lidar com os desafios e solu&ccedil;&otilde;es da Copa do Mundo, com particular aten&ccedil;&atilde;o ao que diz respeito ao design e &agrave; produ&ccedil;&atilde;o da cidade. Publicado por Designing South Africa, o livro questiona diretamente o papel conferido &agrave; Copa do Mundo de forjar uma nova sociedade sul-africana. Ele examina os ambiciosos projetos de espa&ccedil;o p&uacute;blico e transportes que acompanham o evento e desenvolve um di&aacute;logo cr&iacute;tico em torno da concep&ccedil;&atilde;o, implementa&ccedil;&atilde;o e efeitos do evento de uma maneira geral. A publica&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute; vista como o primeiro passo na promo&ccedil;&atilde;o de uma discuss&atilde;o global sobre o papel de mega eventos nas cidades, e como eles podem ser melhor utilizados para catalisar solu&ccedil;&otilde;es urbanas, sejam elas espaciais, sociais ou de infra-estrutura.<br />
<br />
Publicado em ingl&ecirc;s e portugu&ecirc;s, o livro &eacute; tamb&eacute;m o primeiro gesto formal de uma organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o sul-africana em compartilhar experi&ecirc;ncias e informa&ccedil;&otilde;es com o Brasil, pa&iacute;s anfitri&atilde;o da pr&oacute;xima Copa do Mundo e dos Jogos Ol&iacute;mpicos. A publica&ccedil;&atilde;o pode ser entendida como um canal de interc&acirc;mbio entre as duas na&ccedil;&otilde;es, garantindo que as li&ccedil;&otilde;es aprendidas de um evento possam informar melhor ao pr&oacute;ximo. Para &Aacute;frica do Sul, Reflex&otilde;es &amp; Oportunidades apresenta uma plataforma para um maior debate sobre o papel da Copa do Mundo em melhorar a vida dos residentes urbanos, enquanto que para o Brasil, oferece um precedente com curadoria cuidadosa..<br />

<strong>REFLECTIONS &amp; OPPORTUNITIES: DESIGN, CITIES AND THE WORLD CUP  </strong><br />
<br />
Edited by <strong>Zahira Asmal </strong><br />
Foreword by <strong>Dr Danny Jordaan   </strong><br />
<br />
The World Cup 2010 provided an opportunity for South African cities to be reimagined. The investment and infrastructural impetus of the mega event became a catalyst for many public space and public transport projects, which sought to rewire South African cities into more connected, better integrated, more accessible and thus more democratic urban environments.   <br />
<br />
Design was a central component of the World Cup. A diverse range of local and international creative professions were rallied to make the event the success it became - from architects, to graphic designers, urban planners and copywriters &ndash; all were essential. More importantly however, is the fact that these key problem solving skills were sharpened during the World Cup, and a bank of experienced design professionals are now better able to assist South Africa, and other global countries in their future development.   <br />
<br />
Reflections &amp; Opportunities: Design, Cities and the World Cup endeavours to grapple with the challenges and solutions of the World Cup, and in particular, with regards to design and city making. Published by Designing South Africa, the landmark publication directly questions the role the World Cup played in forging a greater South African society. It examines the ambitious public space and transport projects that came with the event and, in general, develops a critical dialogue around the design, implementation and effect of the event. The publication is seen as the first step in fostering a global discussion on the role of mega events in cities, and how they can be better used to catalyse urban solutions, be they spatial, social or infrastructure oriented.   <br />
<br />
Published in both English and Portuguese, the book is also the first formal gesture from a South African organisation, Designing South Africa, to share experience and information with the hosts of the next World Cup and Olympic Games, Brazil. The publication can be understood as a conduit for exchange between the two nations, ensuring that the lessons learned from one event can better inform the next. For South Africa, Reflections &amp; Opportunities presents a platform for a greater debate on the role of the World Cup in improving the lives of urban residents, while for Brazil, it offers a carefully curated precedent. &nbsp;        <br />
<br />
About the editor<br />
<strong> Zahira Asmal</strong> is a creative and cultural commentator, curator and founder of Designing South Africa - an urban research organisation focused on understanding and sharing the process and outcomes of mega-events, particularly related to their impact on the cities that host them, and how this related to urban identity, culture and design. <br />

X-Cities 5: Apps That Engage,Thursday,3,May,2012,Discussion,Studio-X,"Don&#39;t miss the last event in our spring X-Cities series, in which Fast Company&#39;s <strong>Greg Lindsay </strong>and the Institute for the Future&#39;s <strong>Anthony Townsend </strong>have moderated a series of conversations that cast a much-needed critical eye on &quot;smart city&quot; hype.<br />
<br />
While corporations code invisible new urban operating systems to automate energy and traffic networks, city governments and citizen-developers face the far more daunting task of designing engaging interfaces that connect citizens to government, each other, and the built environment.<br />
<br />
Early efforts simply opened up a hodge podge of existing city database to developers, as cities went on a fishing expedition for apps. The results were not impressive. Now, they are getting smarter and commissioning more targeted projects that address real citizen needs and support broader policy agendas.<br />
<br />
Joining us to explore this rapidly expanding design space, as computing moves off the desktop and into the streets, are <strong>Hana Schank</strong>, Principal at Collective User Experience, and <strong>Jake Barton</strong>, founder of museum and public space design firm Local Projects. We&#39;ll be discussing Schank&#39;s <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1800674/new-york-city-big-apps-roadify-sportify"" target=""_blank"">recent critique of city-sponsored technology projects in New York</a>, as well as Barton&#39;s <a href=""http://nyc.changeby.us/#start"" target=""_blank"">award-winning efforts </a>to beef up the Big Apple&#39;s citizen-centered capabilities.<br />
<br />
This promises to be a lively discussion between two inspiring urban thinkers: we hope you can join us!<br />

Book Launch for Five North American Architects,Monday,30,April,2012,Book Launch,Publications,"On the occasion of <strong>Kenneth Frampton</strong>&rsquo;s eightieth birthday, five distinguished practices based in North America came to GSAPP to discuss their work and its ongoing dialogue with Frampton&rsquo;s thinking: Steven Holl Architects (New York), Rick Joy (Tucson) Patkau Architects (Vancouver), Stanley Saitowitz (San Francisco), and Shim + Sutcliffe Architects(Toronto). An in depth survey of recent work by each of the firms, Five Architects: A North American Anthology brings together practices which, while all distinct, share a particularly sensitive feeling for the impact of craftsmanship and climate on the generation of form, as well as an equally shared concern for the expressive tactility of material and the articulation of structure under the impact of light. Essays by Frampton as well as each of the invited practitioners, reconsider the specificity of the work within the larger North American context, taking stock of the practice of architecture on the continent today.<br />

The life and work of Yoshiko Sato, internationally recognized architect and Adjunct Associate Professor at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, will be celebrated in an afternoon of memorial tributes from colleagues, faculty, students, and friends on Sunday April 29, 2012 at 3pm in Wood Auditorium. The exhibition of her work <strong>&ldquo;YOSHIKO SATO, 1960&ndash;2012&rdquo;</strong> will be on view from April 23 to May 4, 2012.<br />
<br />
A native of Tokyo, Yoshiko Sato lived and worked in New York City from 1984 until her recent death from cancer on February 5, 2012, at the age of 51. She studied architecture at The Cooper Union and the Harvard Graduate School of Design, graduating from both with high honors. She was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a Mellon Grant, the Paris Prize, New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship(s), and the Young Architects Award.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In 1996, Yoshiko Sato established the Morris Sato Studio with her husband, Michael Morris. She completed projects across a broad range of scales in cross-disciplinary pursuits and collaborations that straddled architecture, art, and design and brought international recognition as one of the rising talents of her generation. In 1998, she received an award for the Best Exhibition in North America from the International Association of Art Critics for the retrospective exhibition &ldquo;Shiro Kuramata 1934&ndash;1991.&rdquo; In 2002, the Morris Sato Studio received the Home of the Year Award from Architecture Magazine for the Winter House and Studio in Falls Village, Connecticut. In 2003, Sato was selected as a semi-finalist for the Hoboken September 11 Memorial, and in 2008, she won the top award for her installation project &ldquo;LightShowers&rdquo; at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York City.<br />
<br />
Widely known for their museum exhibition designs and residential projects, Sato and Morris&rsquo; work reached its most personal and comprehensive exploration in a pair of recently completed houses on Shelter Island, New York.<br />
<br />
Morris Sato Studio&rsquo;s design portfolio extended to the permanent display of the exhibition, archives, and executive suites for the American Express Company in New York and showrooms, offices, and trade show pavilions for the DuPont Company. Their work with DuPont resulted in a series of ongoing assignments to reimagine spaces and products for health care facilities, including most recently a suite of patient care rooms.<br />
<br />
Although Yoshiko had long settled into the architecture culture of New York City, her link to Japan remained strong. In the aftermath of 9/11, Sato authored several articles for leading Japanese newspapers, as well as the article &ldquo;Remediating Earth&rdquo; in the publication Renewing, Remembering, Rebuilding that bridged the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and the Kobe earthquake.<br />
<br />
As an educator, Sato was committed to repairing the world through design. Teaching allowed Yoshiko to pursue her most wide-ranging interests. Appointed in 1999 at Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, Yoshiko continued to teach and to serve as the director of the Japan Lab in Architecture at Columbia until being recently overtaken by illness.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sato&rsquo;s teachings ranged from sustainable design to a longstanding passion&mdash;the architecture of outer space. At Columbia and with Morris Sato Studio, she led research and project investigations for developing Space Habitation Modules with participation from NASA, international scientists, engineers, artists and others. Her space research at Columbia included collaborating with the late Eiko Ishioka on key costumes for the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony. In June 2009, she was selected to present her team and students&rsquo; work at The International Humans in Space Conference in Moscow.<br />
<br />
At Yoshiko Sato&rsquo;s behest, Columbia GSAPP will announce at the memorial event the establishment of the <strong>SATO SPACE ARCHITECTURE FUND</strong>. The fund is to support her legacy and to expand upon her teaching on the architecture of outer space with an annual grant for related travel and research.",New York,Wood Auditorium

X-Cities 4: Cities-as-a-Service,Thursday,19,April,2012,Discussion,Studio-X,"If, as Cisco suggests, the &quot;network is the next utility,&quot; then are smart cities the next great natural monopoly? With the world&#39;s governments living austerely for the foreseeable future, it seems as though it will fall to private actors to finance the estimated $350 trillion needed to build, maintain, and operate the world&#39;s cities over the next forty years. This has led to smart cities experiments such as Songdo IBD (pictured above) and PlanIT Valley &mdash; experimental prototype cities of tomorrow developed by commercial entities and paid for with investors&#39; money. In return, both cities hope to develop for-profit services that residents will happily pay for &mdash; apps for everyday life.<br />
<br />
Joining us to discuss the creation of such services is Living PlanIT EVP <strong>Eric Brisson</strong> and FiTech Consultants managing partner<strong> Ian Marlow</strong>. Brisson joined Living PlanIT in 2011, as their executive vice president of Product Marketing overseeing the development of new products and solutions. Marlow has spent the past three years advising Songdo developer Gale International on the design, development, and strategy of the technology needed to service and manage the largest private real estate development project in the world (at an estimate price of $35 billion).<br />
<br />
This will be a unique opportunity to learn about the decisions and calculations that go into the creation of these for-profit smart city prototypes &mdash; we hope you can join us and add your questions and comments to the conversation!<br />

<br />
Pensar e praticar urbanidade da forma que v&iacute;nhamos fazendo nos &uacute;ltimos s&eacute;culos tem sido uma forma de excluir tudo que parece ser fora de moda. Ainda que muito desapercebida, a produ&ccedil;&atilde;o de energia e comida tem se tornado um campo importante para a criatividade, a pesquisa e a intera&ccedil;&atilde;o - qualidades fundamentais da urbanidade. Atrav&eacute;s dos conceitos de Ator-Rede-Paisagem e Paisagens Integrais, investigamos os potenciais de uma paisagem cultural sustent&aacute;vel para o nosso futuro, focalizando em atores ousados. Mostrando o estudo de caso de Bad Blumau na &Aacute;ustria, Bernhard vai mostrar como essa nova forma de pensar urbanidade pode acontecer em qualquer lugar.<br />

<br />
Thinking and practicing urbanity the way we did during the last centuries has been the way of excluding everything that seems to be unfashionable. Unseen, the production of energy or food is becoming a major field for creativity, research and interaction - fundamental qualities for urbanity. Within the concepts of Actor-Network-Landscapes and Integral Landscapes we try to research the potentials of our future sustainable cultural landscape, focusing on venturous actors.<br />
<br />
Through the case study of Bad Blumau in Austria, Bernhard will show how this new way of thinking urbanity can happen anywhere. Bernhard K&ouml;nig is professor and researcher at the Institute for Architecture and Landscape - would LANDLAB &amp; l, Graz University of Technology.

Colour and Colour Collections: Valuable Tools for Architects,Thursday,12,April,2012,Seminar,Studio-X,"<p>As our world evolves, architecture and colour continue its relationship with fashion and art, and is increasingly becoming one of the most exciting forms of contemporary living and expression. Environmental concerns remain at the forefront. There is a distinct &ldquo;human&rdquo; element as a backlash to the perfectionism of the increasingly technological world. The&nbsp;need for escapism increases and architects and designers meet these demands by creating innovative colourful spaces. The element of surprise plays an increasingly important role in building and decorating, from illuminated facades through to small-scale venues that burst with innovative colour and light. In the future, we will build organically, truly inspired by Mother Nature&rsquo;s simple, yet perfectly formed structures.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>THE SPEAKER</strong><br />
	<br />
	The lectures and the workshops will be directed by <strong>Professor Axel Venn</strong> from Berlin/Germany. Professor Venn is a worldwide renowned expert in colour design and trend scouting. His 18 books about colour have been translated in 12 languages all over the world. He is a consultant to important companies in industry and commerce in Europe and in overseas. Presently Professor Venn is preparing a book on colour and colour-systems especially for the Chinese market.<br />

With apologies to Winston Churchill, first we define the application stack of smart cities, and thereafter they stack us. How will the demands of citizens shape the deployment of urban systems, and how will the capabilities and limitations of these systems, in turn, reshape cities? With short presentations followed by a lively discussion, special guests <strong>Guru Banavar</strong> of IBM and <strong>Leif Percifeld</strong>, creator of <a href=""http://dontflush.me/"">DontFlush.Me</a>, will help us compare and contrast radically different approaches to questions surrounding the governance of intelligent infrastructure.<br />
<br />
As VP and CTO of IBM&#39;s Global Public Sector, Dr. Guru Banavar has been at the forefront of IBM&#39;s efforts to create smarter, more sustainable cities. On the heels of the severe weather events in Rio in 2010, Dr. Banavar led a collaboration that resulted in the creation of the city&#39;s operations center &mdash; a command center that integrates and interconnects information from over 30 government departments and public agencies in the municipality to improve emergency response management, deliver better city services, and enhance the quality of life for the citizens of Rio.<br />
<br />
Following Dr. Banavar&#39;s insights into IBM&#39;s collaboration with the City of Rio, technologist and designer Leif Percifeld of the <a href=""http://publiclaboratory.org/home"">Public Laboratory</a> will discuss his involvement in projects that encourage citizen participation and information collection around urban infrastructure and environmental issues, including DontFlush.Me, a lightweight sensor network aimed at preventing Combined Sewer Overflows during downpours, and the Air Quality Egg, a community-driven air quality data-gathering project.<br />

<strong>David Chambers</strong>, London<br />
Aberrant Architecture &eacute; um est&uacute;dio e think-tank multi-disciplinar, fundado por David Chambers e Kevin Haley, que opera internacionalmente nas &aacute;reas de arquitetura, design, arte contempor&acirc;nea e an&aacute;lise cultural. A partir de seu est&uacute;dio em Londres, eles se esfor&ccedil;am para capturar o melhor do passado e do contempor&acirc;neo, a fim de moldar o futuro do mundo desenvolvido.<br />
<br />
O est&uacute;dio construiu uma reputa&ccedil;&atilde;o atrav&eacute;s de projetos l&uacute;dicos, interativos e provocadores que utilizam arquitetura e design para introduzir formas novas e inesperadas de experimentar o mundo. Eles colaboram regularmente com comunidades locais, profissionais de design e colocam as pessoas no cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de tudo o que fazem.<br />
<br />
Operando simultaneamente como um think tank, Aberrant Architecture identifica, questiona e pesquisa temas relevantes na sociedade contempor&acirc;nea, a fim de olhar para al&eacute;m da &quot;constru&ccedil;&atilde;o do edif&iacute;cio&rdquo;&nbsp; e se estabelecer tamb&eacute;m como solucionadores de problemas, al&eacute;m de designers.<br />
<br />
Em 2010 foram arquitetos-residentes no Museu Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A), e no mesmo ano que co-fundaram o The Gopher Hole, uma galeria / casa de shows em Londres que, atrav&eacute;s e um programa de exposi&ccedil;&otilde;es e palestras p&uacute;blicas, fornece uma plataforma para o debate cr&iacute;tico sobre das artes e da sociedade.<br />

<strong>DANIELA BRASIL</strong><br />
Professora assistente no Institut f&uuml;r Kunst Zeitgen&ouml;ssische - Architektur Fakult&auml;t - TUGraz.<br />
<br />
Daniela Brasil tem doutoramento e mestrado em Arte P&uacute;blica na Universidade Bauhaus, em Weimar, e estudou arte e urbanismo tamb&eacute;m no Rio de Janeiro, Lisboa e Oxford. Ela trabalha principalmente com instala&ccedil;&otilde;es participativas e colaborativas no espa&ccedil;o p&uacute;blico.<br />
<br />
Vindo de uma experi&ecirc;ncia que mistura de arte, arquitetura e urbanismo, Daniela deriva entre essas disciplinas, tanto atrav&eacute;s da pr&aacute;tica como da teoria. Combinando po&eacute;tica com pol&iacute;tica, seu trabalho explora o corpo e a cidade como locais socialmente e culturalmente de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o e de potencial, que se atualizam atrav&eacute;s de experi&ecirc;ncias vividas. Atrav&eacute;s da confec&ccedil;&atilde;o de objetos e instala&ccedil;&otilde;es, juntamente com as interven&ccedil;&otilde;es no debate p&uacute;blico, ela prop&otilde;e mudan&ccedil;as na percep&ccedil;&atilde;o para instigar intera&ccedil;&otilde;es e questionamentos.

<strong>ABERRANT ARCHITECTURE<br />
David Chambers</strong>, London<br />
Aberrant Architecture is a multi-disciplinary studio and think-tank, founded by directors David Chambers and Kevin Haley, that operates internationally in the fields of architecture, design, contemporary art &amp; cultural analysis.&nbsp; From their studio in London, they strive to capture the best of the past and the contemporary in order to shape the future of the designed world.<br />
The studio has established a reputation for playful, provocative and interactive projects that use architecture and design to introduce new and unexpected ways of experiencing the world. They regularly collaborate with local community groups, design professionals and place people at the heart of everything they do.<br />
Operating simultaneously as a think tank, aberrant identify, question and research relevant issues in contemporary society in order to look beyond &lsquo;building a building&rsquo; and to establish themselves as problem solvers as well as designers.<br />
In 2010 they were architecture residents at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) and in the same year they co-founded The Gopher Hole, a gallery/venue in London, which through a public exhibition and talks programme provides a platform for critical debate on the arts and society.<br />
<br />
<strong>DANIELA BRASIL</strong><br />
Daniela Brasil, Assistant professor at the Institut f&uuml;r Zeitgen&ouml;ssische Kunst &ndash; Architektur Fakult&auml;t&nbsp; &ndash; TUGraz.<br />
Daniela Brasil holds a PhD and a MFA in Public art from the Bauhaus Universit&auml;t in Weimar and has studied art and urbanism also in Rio, Lisbon and Oxford. She works mainly with participatory and collaborative installations in public space.<br />
Coming from an intertwined background of art, architecture and urbanism, Daniela drifts across these disciplines, both through practice and theory. Combining poetics with politics, her work explores the body and the city as socially and culturally situated sites of investigation and potential, that are actualized through lived experiences. Through the making of objects and installations, together with interventions into public debate, she propose shifts in perception, instigate interactions and question behaviors.<br />

"You're Welcome: Gentrification Offsetting, Discussion & Design",Wednesday,4,April,2012,Discussion,Studio-X,"On Wednesday, April 4, Studio-X NYC is delighted to host a discussion and design charrette organized by Jacqueline Cooksey and Benjamin Winter from the MFA in Transdisciplinary Design program at Parsons The New School for Design:<br />
<br />
<br />
Studio-X NYC, 180 Varick St., Suite 1610<br />
<em>Free and open to the public. Please RSVP to <a href=""mailto:WELCOMESBURG@GMAIL.COM"">WELCOMESBURG@GMAIL.COM</a></em><br />
<br />
What&#39;s your gentrification footprint? How can you offset displacement in your neighborhood? Join us as we explore these and other questions of individual agency and accountability in collective urban change. Through discussion and design, we will examine what makes someone a &quot;gentrifier&quot; and what they can do about it.<br />
<br />
This two-part workshop will be led by <strong>Jacqueline Cooksey </strong>and <strong>Benjamin Winter</strong>, with special guests will <strong>Tom Angotti</strong> (Hunter), <strong>Aurash Khawarzard</strong> (DoTank), <strong>Elliot Montgomery</strong> (Parsons), <strong>Lincoln Restler</strong> (State Committee), and more. Following a discussion of questions raised by Cooksey and Winter&#39;s Welcomesburg project, they will facilitate an informal co-design session to create new &quot;gentrification offsets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Come for the open discussion (and snacks) at 6pm and stay for the design charrette (and drinks) at 8pm. All are welcome; no prior experience or expertise in either gentrification or design necessary.",New York,Studio-X NYC

<em>Free and open to the public. No RSVP required.</em><br />
<br />
Join us for another evening in our Live Interview @ Studio-X series, as we host an informal public discussion with <strong>McKenzie Wark</strong>, author of<em> Gamer Theory, A Hacker Manifesto, Telesthesia</em>, and (our focus for Tuesday&#39;s conversation), <em>The Beach Beneath the Street</em>, a new history of Guy Debord and the Situationist International.<br />
<br />
As Wark writes in his introduction, &quot;It&#39;s time to start scheming on how to leave the twenty-first century. The pessimists are right. Things can&#39;t go on as they are. The optimists are also right. Another world is possible.&quot; What we need-and why the Situationists remain so urgently relevant today-is a kind of counter-guide to the city, an abuser&#39;s manual, inspired by the unrealized potential of Situationist practice. We need, in Wark&#39;s words, &quot;low theory,&quot; or &quot;a critical thought indifferent to the institutional forms of the academy or the art world.&quot; We hope you can join us on Tuesday, April 3, to speculate with Wark on what form(s) such DIY urban counter-navigation might take.",New York,Studio-X NYC

Social Media for Urban Research,Tuesday,27,March,2012,Panel,Studio-X,"Social media are increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives, from connecting with friends and sharing images to exploring cities through location-based applications. These new services have given us a different vantage point from which to understand, explore, navigate, and geographically record the places we live.<br />
<br />
This panel discussion brings together academics, professionals, and journalists who are researching, building, and using social media data to better understand our urban environment. How does the introduction of place-based social media affect our relationship to the city? Who&#39;s creating these data points and what can it show us about how the city is used? How can large private data sets be used for a public good?<br />
<br />
Join Studio-X NYC and the Spatial Information Design Lab for a conversation about the potential of social media in urban research, featuring <strong>Sarah Williams</strong> of the Spatial Information Design Lab, <strong>Brett Martin</strong> of Sonar.me, <strong>Blake Shaw</strong> of Foursquare, and other speakers to be announced.<br />
<br />
Also on display, <em>Here Now! Social Media and the Psychological City</em><br />
<br />
Sites such as Foursquare and Facebook allow us to spatially mark our explorations in the city, creating rich databases that hold digital imprints of our interactions. For this exhibition, the Foursquare and Facebook Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) were used to access location-based data to determine where social media users broadcast that they are &quot;Here Now.&quot;<br />

Interpretations: Promiscuous Encounters,Friday,23,March,2012,Symposium,CCCP,"<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Promiscuous Encounters</strong> has two main ambitions: first, to examine the fascinating blurriness and productive interplay between the critical, curatorial and conceptual capacities of architecture, including how and where they intersect and overlap and, second, to expand the definitions of what these terms mean in relation to theory and practice by reexamining the sites of criticality and their modes of operation. When and where, we might ask, is an architectural practice Critical, Curatorial or Conceptual today? Can we, or would we want to, separate these kinds of practices or are we subject to an inevitable and productive <em>promiscuity</em>?</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Format</strong></span><br />
<br />
Promiscuous Encounters will take the form of a day-long, roundtable seminar with invited speakers from multiple backgrounds to open discussion. The seminar is organized as two sessions, each one with four 10-minute presentations addressing a set of questions regarding the Critical, Curatorial and Conceptual in architecture. Everyone attending the event is invited to actively engage in the conversation. The seminar will not be video or audio recorded, however, everyone attending is encouraged to &ldquo;record&rdquo; their own interpretation of the Promiscuous Encounters via their notes, sketches, photographs or subsequent reflections. These interpretations will form the basis of a forthcoming printed publication of the event.<br />

X-Cities 2: My Life Inside Big Data,Tuesday,20,March,2012,Lecture,Studio-X,"In the past decade we&#39;ve cycled from an Orwellian response to 9/11, locking down public data access, to an open data movement that promises to transform government. In both cases cities have been at the nexus of discussion and policy. Now we are on the precipice of another shift in the data landscape with the emergence of pervasive real time sensors, arriving in the form of mobile devices.<br />
<br />
Special guest <strong>Sean Gorman</strong>, founder of GeoIQ, will cover his voyage through these shifts - from navigating the threat of university collected open data being classified by the government, to starting an open data crowdsourcing site funded by the government, and then to trading beer for data in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. What kinds of scenarios will the new streams of data emerging from mobile devices and social media create, and what will their impact be on the city?<br />
<br />
Sean Gorman is the founder of GeoIQ, a collaborative web platform for geographic data analysis. Previously he was in academia as a research professor at George Mason University and before that a graduate student at the University of Florida. In between he worked for startups in the DC area building online communities, providing Geo-IP location, and mapping telecom infrastructure.<br />

"Book Signing and Launch for Dan Graham's New Jersey",Saturday,3,March,2012,Book Launch,Publications,"<em>Dan Graham&#39;s New Jersey</em> is the first book to compile Graham&#39;s&nbsp;photographs of New Jersey from 1966 to the present. Collecting the&nbsp;original photographs from Graham&#39;s iconic Homes for America series,&nbsp;Dan Graham&#39;s New Jersey pairs these with new photographs taken in the&nbsp;context of a study trip with the architecture faculty of Columbia&nbsp;University. The new images exhibit stark similarities to the older&nbsp;ones, taken in the same suburban locations that Graham photographed in&nbsp;the 1960s. The juxtaposition creates a fascinating play of repetitions&nbsp;and differences that raise questions regarding the future of&nbsp;architecture, suburbia, and public space.<br />

Architectural Colonialism: Richard Neutra and Latin America,Thursday,1,March,2012,Lecture,Latin Lab,"Ettinger examines the discourse Austrian-American architect Richard J. Neutra in relation to the notion of an &ldquo;American&rdquo; architecture and his publications on the role of architecture in dealing with social needs in South America, specifically programs for hospitals, schools and community centers based primarily on his experience in Puerto Rico. It illustrates both his perspective as &ldquo;missionary&rdquo; to Latin America and the reception of this discourse in the region.<br />
<br />
Catherine R. Ettinger is a full professor in the Architecture School at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol&aacute;s de Hidalgo where she has occupied diverse administrative positions and currently teaches architecture theory. She was trained as an architect with a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Preservation of Historic Sites and Buildings (1998) and a Doctorate in Architecture (2001) from the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico.

C-BIP Brooklyn: Vectored Development,Friday,24,February,2012,Conference,C-BIP,"<p>The Columbia Building Intelligence Project (C-BIP), organized by the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) is pleased to convene its sixth think tank in Brooklyn to rethink the future of the building industry in four 60-minute sessions followed by roundtable discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From commercial expansion along the Red Hook waterfront to a new sports arena in the downtown business district, Brooklyn&#39;s rapidly changing skyline, infrastructure, and demographics are rich and complex. What developed from pastoral origins through phases of industrial manufacturing, military production, back-office support for Manhattan, and the service industry has evolved into a contemporary capital for small-business, entertainment, and media. This sixth C-BIP think tank will explore scenarios triggered by these and other recent explosions in urban development in New York City&#39;s most populous borough.</p>

	1:15-2:15 PM<br />
	The AEC industry is becoming increasingly defined by specialized tasks that extend far beyond the traditional triad of architects, engineers, and contractors. What future models of practice will be facilitated by digital communication technologies in the context of increasing specialized information? Does the ability to establish global connected practices tend toward the consolidation of expertise into large aggregate, vertically integrated firms that bring all activities in-house and under a controlled setting? Or does it favor smaller, more agile, and horizontally networked practices that join together on a per project basis?</p>
<p><br />
	<strong>Panel 2<br />
	The Design of Design Software</strong><br />
	2:15-3:15 PM<br />
	Complex architecture and construction projects involve complex software. While one trend in architecture software involves the integration of many aspects of design and construction into a single Building Information Model, another trend involves the use of many custom scripts and programs to perform unique tasks for specific projects. This panel will explore innovative examples of design software and some of the issues that they raise. What are the gaps in architecture software, and who should write the code to fill them in? Should custom scripts and programs eventually be generalized and incorporated into comprehensive software applications? Who should own and use the scripts? What kinds of assumptions and intelligence are embedded in different kinds of software? How are the assumptions and intelligence visible in design interfaces and built designs? How reusable is the intelligence encapsulated in algorithms?</p>
<p><br />
	<strong>Panel 3<br />
	Buidling Accountability</strong><br />
	3:30-4:30 PM<br />
	In order to account for themselves, buildings today must interact with and provide increasing amounts of data to entities that range from individuals to governments. Are buildings getting smarter or stupider in the process? As the demand for measuring energy consumption and the passage of things and people in and out of buildings around the globe grows, what can be learned from the fact that we nowadays coordinate much more than we design and plan? Furthermore, what does this mean for the practices and policies-private or public, individual or collective- that intersect with buildings?</p>
<p><br />
	<strong>Panel 4<br />
	Buidlings: Infrastructure: Cities</strong><br />
	4:30-5:30 PM<br />
	Commercial and residential development has often been at odds with the concept of environmental efficiency. However, the regulatory legislation at city, regional, and federal levels is poised to change the way we view energy and carbon in the built environment. The strategies that drive change are also new systems of change. Understanding evolving scales of efficiency for user&#39;s end requirements, performance, and &quot;feel&quot; changes as this generation realigns working and living environments to meet the demands of higher performance levels. This adjustment is required to address opportunities offered by dissonant constituents of the rapidly changing environmental supply chain of vectored development.</p>

X-Cities 1: Making the Case for Smart,Tuesday,21,February,2012,Discussion,Studio-X,"Lindsay and Townsend are calling the series &quot;X-Cities,&quot; where X marks the spot at which information technology and mega-urbanization converge. In this first session, the pair will lay out their respective cases for the top-down, intelligent design of &quot;smart cities&quot; versus the bottom-up evolution of crowd-sourced &quot;civic laboratories.&quot; <strong>Is information technology a real tool for city-building?</strong> And, if so, what is its bright and/or scary future?<br />
<br />
Lindsay and Townsend will also lay the groundwork for future X-Cities sessions this spring, which feature a stellar list of participants responding to questions on how the relationship between cities and government is being reshaped by ubiquitous computing, what role the private sector will play, how smart technology might redesign the physical fabric of the city, and what the limits on data sharing in tomorrow&#39;s open cities should be.<br />
<br />
The entire series promises to be a lively, intriguing, and potentially contentious extended discussion: don&#39;t miss the kick-off on Tuesday!<br />

LI@SX: Stanley Greenberg,Thursday,16,February,2012,Live Interview,Studio-X,"<p>Studio-X NYC welcomes photographer <strong>Stanley Greenberg</strong> for a live interview and public discussion of his work. Stanley Greenberg is widely celebrated for his photographic studies of New York City infrastructure, from remote dams and reservoirs located far outside the city to underground pieces of the metropolis now off-limits to photographers. His most recent work, published under the title Time Machines, is a globe-trotting study of large-scale physics equipment. The telescopes, particle accelerators, spectrometers, ion traps, and LIDAR installations featured in the book combine an overwhelming density of function with the strange poetry of advanced scientific endeavors. &quot;To find the sites in this book,&quot; Greenberg explains in a brief afterword, &quot;I traveled over 80,000 miles, by plane, bus, train, car and on foot. I went deep underground, high up in the mountains, and to the southernmost point on the earth.&quot;</p>

Latino Urbanism: Retrofitting the Suburb,Thursday,16,February,2012,Lecture,Latin Lab,"Latinos bring public life to auto oriented streets and public spaces in the suburbs through their cultural behavior patterns. Their homes, ciudades, pueblos, and ranchos in Latin America are structured differently both physically and socially than the suburb. This phenomena can be seen and experience in suburbs across the US&nbsp; by the way Latinos retrofit the urban design of the streets to support their needs.&nbsp; Street vendors carrying their wares, pushing carts or setting up temporary tables and tarps, vivid colors, murals and business signs, clusters of people socializing on street corners and over front yard fences, and the furniture and props that make these front yards into personal statements all contribute to the vivid, unique landscape of the city.<br />
<br />
James Rojas is an urban planner, community activist, and artist. He is one of the few nationally recognized urban planners to examine U.S. Latino cultural influences on urban design. He holds a Master of City Planning and a Master of Science of Architecture Studies from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Rojas founded the Latino Urban Forum (LUF), a volunteer advocacy group dedicated to understanding and improving the built environment of Los Angeles&rsquo; Latino communities. LUF has recruited urban planners, architects, artists, and public administrators to lend their knowledge and influence to innovate and address the issues of the underserved, and often underprivileged, Latino communities of Los Angeles.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pneumatic tube transportation has a long and mixed history in New York - the city&#39;s first subterranean railway was a 294ft-long pneumatic tube opened in 1870 beneath City Hall, and, to this day, Roosevelt Island&#39;s pneumatic tube trash system means that its 12,000 residents never have to buy garbage bags.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In between, you watch the films at home-or anywhere you may be-and then get online to discuss the films in the comments on BLDGBLOG or using the Twitter hashtag&nbsp;<a href=""http://go.madmimi.com/redirects/94ea1f58e918a4fa18177ef72d000fd3?pa=7351221122"" target=""_blank"">#BREAKOUTBREAKIN</a>. It&#39;s a &quot;distributed&quot; film fest; there is no central venue, set screening time, or overpriced popcorn: just a curated list of films and some guidance as to the dates you should watch and discuss them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described on <a href=""http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/breaking-out-and-breaking-in.html"">BLDGBLOG</a>, the festival&#39;s &quot;overall idea is to discuss breaking out and breaking in as spatial scenarios that operate as mirror images of one another, each process with its own tools, techniques, and unique forms of unexpected architectural expertise.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we shift perspective and setting, from British soldiers tunneling out of German prisoner-of-war camps to the stifling claustrophobia of a residential panic room turned trap, we&#39;ll be discussing the unexpected insights escapees, burglars, and security officers can offer into the built environment. What lessons can architects, urbanists, designers, and citizens learn from the vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and alternate access routes embedded in these fictional settings?</p>

LI@SX: Dredge Research Collaborative,Tuesday,24,January,2012,Live Interview,Studio-X,"<p>For the first LI@SX of 2012, Studio-X NYC is delighted to welcome <strong>Rob Holmes</strong> and <strong>Stephen Becker</strong> of <a href=""http://m.ammoth.us/blog/"">Mammoth</a>&nbsp;and <strong>Tim Maly</strong> of <a href=""http://quietbabylon.com/"">Quiet Babylon</a>, three-quarters of the Dredge Research Collaborative (with <strong>Brett Milligan</strong> of <a href=""http://freeassociationdesign.wordpress.com/"">Free Association Design</a>), for a short visual tour of hulking geotubes, silt fences, sensate geotextiles, and other monuments of the dredge cycle, followed by a lively Q&amp;A and informal discussion on the unrecognized architectural possibilities of dredge.</p>
<p>Every year, billions of tons of earth are moved by erosion caused by humans and by humans in response to erosion. The Dredge Cycle is landscape architecture at a monumental scale, carving the coastlines and waterways of continents according to a mixture of industrial need and unintended consequences. Thus far, it has remained the domain of logistics, industry, and engineering, a soft successor to the elevated freeway interchanges and massive dams that captured the cultural imagination of the previous century: a new infrastructural vernacular for the self-aware Anthropocene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for the past year, the Dredge Research Collaborative have been exploring the choreography of these interconnected sedimentary landscapes, visiting dredged material confinement areas from Poplar Island in the Chesapeake Bay to Hayden Island in the Columbia River, talking with dredge-experts such as the transnational materials conglomerate TenCate, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of Land Management, and publishing and lecturing widely on dredge.</p>
<p>The evening&#39;s conversation will serve as a prelude to a limited-ticket Dredgefest tour this summer, for which LI@SX attendees will be given reservation priority.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Unsolicited Architecture highlights the need for a more active role of architects in society through an action-oriented architecture! In today&#39;s world, the architects can no longer rely on custom work alone. The old rule of waiting for customers, contracts and land no longer applies. Architects must explore and even create demands and opportunities for themselves. Unsolicited Architecture is about acting rather than reacting, developing new insights and tools to deal with the today&#39;s challenges&nbsp; - it&#39;s about reinventing the profession.</p>

A antiga regra de esperar por clientes, contratos e terrenos no se aplica mais. Os arquitetos devem prospectar e at criar demandas e oportunidades para si prprios.&nbsp;Unsolicited Architecture&nbsp; sobre agir em vez de reagir, desenvolver novas vises e ferramentas para lidar com os desafios atuais - sobre reinventar a profisso.&nbsp;<br />

<p class=""p1"">Based on the interest in discussing the recent changes to the Tiradentes Square, a group of designers, architects, artists and scientists met to analyze and propose ways to interfere in public space. The mapping has emerged as a means of converging the tools of analysis and representation of these different disciplines.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Going beyond the traditional idea of ​​mapping the work understands the public space as transient, constantly moving. Mapping the movement of persons, temporary uses or large structural changes are also representations of flows.</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">The exhibition will occupy the Carioca Design Center with two proposed maps developed by the group during the process.</p>
